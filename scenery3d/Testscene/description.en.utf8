<h2>Testscene</h2>

<p>This scene is mostly useful as testbed for your own
developments. You should make a copy of the scene folder and modify at
will, try material settings or some other details to find out how this
plugin behaves. Then build and present your own work!</p>

<h4>Coordinate and orientation tests</h4>

<p>The pillars shown here, as seen from the structure's center,
provide an approximate view (not hi-precision!) to solstice/equinox
sunrise/sunset positions in central European latitudes. The central
pillars provide an east-west-line. The survey coordinate grid visible
on the floor does not align with geographic north.  A rotation of -4.2
deg (test for meridian convergence) must be compensated, i.e., while
the central pillars must absolutely and always point west-east, 
the grid lines hit the northern horizon slightly (4.2 deg) left of north!</p>

<p>Walkaround ground coordinates (Ctrl-R, T) should display the
coordinates visible along the south and west border of the
ground.</p>

<h4>Material test</h4>

<p>This model is also used for testing the plugin's graphical
capabilities. You can play with material parameters to create funny
effects like semitransparent or glow-in-the-dark brick spheres.</p>

<p>To test temporal features, the pillars and spheres are visible only from the years 2000 until 2020. 
Edit the material file to change that!</p>
