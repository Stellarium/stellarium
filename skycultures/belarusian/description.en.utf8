<h1>Belarusian</h1>
<p>Shown here are some interesting folk astronomy constellations found in Belarus, a country in Eastern Europe bordered by Russia to the northeast, 
Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the northwest. Belarus is landlocked and contains large tracts of marshy land 
and thousands of lakes. Forests cover about 40% of the country. Belarus is exceptional in that people in the villages have preserved their traditional 
knowledge about the stars and related beliefs, right through to the present time. The illustrations are by no means exhaustive. In fact, many 
asterisms have multiple recorded meanings, ranging from ancient to Christianized.</p>
