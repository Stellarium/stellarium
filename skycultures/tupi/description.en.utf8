<h2>Tupi-Guarani</h2>

<h3>Constellations</h3>
<p>As with many cultures, constellations were identified and used to help keep track of the seasons and predict the seasonal variations which affect daily life.  In the book <i>Histoire de la Mission de Pères Capucins en l'Isle de Maragnan et
terres circonvoisins</i>, published in Paris, 1614, it is stated that the Tupi people identified some thirty constellations, but the book only details seven.</p>

<h4>Ema</h4>
<p>The Tupi name for this constellation is <i>Iandutim</i> (<i>Guirá Nhandu</i> in
Guarani), which literally translates to <i>White Ostrich</i>. The constellation depicts a large bird. </p>
<p>In the first two weeks of June this constellation is fully visible in the Eastern sky in the evening, indicating the beginning of Winter in the South of Brazil, and the start of the dry season in the North.</p>

<h4>Homem Velho (the Old Man)</h4>
<p>This constellation depicts an old man holding a stick.</p>
<p>In the second half of December, the constellation is fully visible in the evening Eastern sky.  This marks the beginning of summer in the southern parts of Brazil and the start of the rainy season in the North.</p>
