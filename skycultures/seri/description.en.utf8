<h1>Seri (Comca'ac)</h1> 


<p><img src="abuela.png" width="250" align="left" />The description of the Comca'ac (Seri) Constellations presented here comes from the book "Bajo el cielo Comca'ac: Astronom&#237;a entre el mar y el desierto", 
written by Arturo Morales Blanco, in which it is possible to identify the relations between sky, sea and desert, as they are recovered by oral tradition and family memories. </p>
<p> This knowledge has arrived to us by oral transmission from generation to generation, 
through time and shows how the events from the sea as the appearance of crabs or the abundance of Totoaba (now in danger), 
comes along with the presence of sets stars in the sky. Comca'ac people has named them Zaamth or Zix cam caoc'la, respectively; 
also, the coincidence of Pitahayas in the cactus with the appearance of constellation H&#225;cosa (Corta-pitahayas) in the sky is very suggestive.</p>
<p> There have been six different Comca'ac groups (Comca'ac means "people"): Xica  hacataj quitoj, 
whom eat meat of sharks, inhabit San Esteban Island; Xnamotat, whom lev in the south, inhabit San Carlos, Guaymas and Tastiota; 
Cail hitic 'tamoc, the man from the valley, inhabit the region between Tastiota and Bah&#237;a Kino; Heno comca'ac, whom live in the mountain, 
inhabit the centre of Tibur&#225;n Island; Tepocaj, the fishermen, whom inhabit between Puerto Libertad y Puerto Pe&#241;asco; and, Tosni hox hanoquipilc, 
whom feed themselves sea birds (ducks and pel&#237;canos), inhabit Island San Esteban.</p>

<h2>Constellations</h2>

<div>
<h3>Zaamth</h3>

<p> <img src="jaiba.png" height="100" align="left" />
When the stars of the Orion's Belt, Rigel y Betelgeuse appear above the western horizon, in the month of march, Comca'ac people seen how in shallow waters of the marsh, the crabs are found forming groups of 300 and 400 
items which can be collected easily; that is the reason to call Zaamth to constellation. After six months, when the sea is cold, the crabs does not appear any more going from one place to another; 
instead the sea wheat, xnois, comes and their seed is used to make flour and different food plates for centuries. The legend says that the days corresponding to the crab 
"harvesting", it must avoid to broke a leg of a daw because, if this happens, the day after will not be more crabs at the site.

<h3>Cohamc</h3>
<p><img src="cohamc.png" height="100" align="left" />
About October 18th, an alignment of stars takes place in the sky and it is called, since ancient times, as Cohamc constellation, women.  
Then four or five days after the rains begin to fall with intensity and the wind runs by the desert. The star that is at the north of the alignment, the Comca'ac's name is 
Hacamta, the husband, and is the one appearing behind the other six named women, (the star Psi of Ursa Major); the six stars appear in sequence, two by two.
The forecast of this bad weather motivated their ancestors to go to the caves in the mountain and to go far from the beach. After the difficult days, around two months later, 
Comca'ac people returned to the beach carrying with them all the food and materials kept along: dried meat, fish, caguama, honey, and flour from 'p&#233;chita de mezquite', between them.</p>

<p><img src="hazoj_canoj.png" height="100" align="left" />
This star that appears alone in the sky with its multicolour shine, can be seen along the year. 
It is necessary to get up at 4 or 5 in the morning. This star corresponds to Sirius and it announces the new day. 
The legend says that when some one get up when the Sun has already in the sky, all his tents become the peal of the dead. 
 Hazoj means constellation and Hantifica&#235; is "Who comes at the dawn". </p>

<h3>Haapjc</h3>
<p><img src="hapjc.png" height="100"  align="left" />
This constellation is, perhaps, the most complex of Comca'ac ones, due to the fact 
that it covers a wide area in the sky and in it, one can find stars from Taurus, Twins, and the Capella star. 
It can be said that Hapjc (Deer hunter) has: the deer (white tail, bura and cimarr&#243;n) (H&#233;pem, H&#225;ap
and M&#243;jit, respectively) which are the stars known as Hassaleh, Elnath and 123 Tau; the arrow with its
flint at Aldebar&#225;n and the stars forming a 'V' of Taurus, while the fethers are Castor and Pollux of Geminis.
The hunter is Cozaactim ("Who crosses"), properly said, its head at Capella.</p>

</div><div>

<p> The legend says that Cozaactim threw his arrow and hit the Bura deer. H&#225;ap was wounded and flew through the sky bleeding; 
then, a little drop of blood fell in the Tiburon Island, and that is the reason why bura deer are native of the island. 
This constellation can be observed in September sky.</p>

<h3>H&#225;cosa</h3>
<p><img src="hacosa.png" height="100" align="left" />
It is said that when this constellation points to the south, 
seems as the instrument H&#225;cosa (Pitahaya-cutter), and it is time to collect the wild fruits:
p&#233;chitas of mezquite and pitahayas, for example. 
When there is no sign of it, the season will be bad.</p>

<h3>Hazoj Coiquih</h3>
<p><img src="hazoj_koii.png" height="100" align="left"/>
Between the twelve stars of C&#252;iquih (Person) is the star Antares. 
In this constellation, the person seems to be fishing; that is why, the corresponding legend affirms that Zix hantpatj (cochito fish) 
has at the roof of its mouth a kind of jelly substance, coming from the pulp of a cactus that the ancestors used as bait. 
This constellation goes, month after month, revolving in the sky and it is seen in a recumbent position when at north.</p>

<h3>Caamoilcoj</h3>
<p><img src="caamoilcoj.png" height="100" align="left"/>
This constellation named Camooilcoj (Wheel Game), is one of the most important arrays of stars between Comca'ac people; 
it can be observed at plenitude at winter; with around fifteen stars in a wheeled shape, and stars as tablets of carrizo which plays the role of dice. 
It is said that in ancient times, this game was played by men, exclusively, who put as bet his own life;
now, the game is played at festivals and special occasions by women representing events of life and protection; 
in particular, it is played during puberty ceremonies for example; 
or at the feast of zaaptim (great basket).</p>
<p align="justify"> For this game, a round of pieces of Pitahayas or cinita (today, they are decorated stones with different motives) and three pieces of carrizo, painted in
colours: red meaning the blood and dead; blue representingthe sky and sea; and, white representing purity, good health and protection.</p>

<h3>Quetoh</h3>
<p><img src="quetoh0.png" height="100" align="left"/>
This lonely star is known as Quetoh (little dove), it is modern Arcturus. 
It appears in October announcing an epoch of good fishing. 
The ancestors have not nets neither other fishing arts, they used harpoons to capture their preys and a "flint" harpoon or double point tool. 
The legend says that many years ago, with the appearance of this star in the sky, the floriation of cactus begun and at the end of the week, there were Pitahayas on them; 
however, the next day, all the pitahayas disappeared: it was Quetoh yacaso or 'spell of the dove' responsible of eating that fruit.</p>

<h3>Yay Xapi Hanopas</h3>
<p><img src="yay_xapi.png" height="100" align="left"/>
The young hunter, says the legend, was a boy who went hunting and several weeks after his departure, 
he was still absent and the members of his camp gave him as dead. 
But several months later, at daybreak, he shown himself to his parents who were surprised telling him: 
"We think you have daid, we have many days looking for you, until we were tired; we cried for you a lot". 
The young man told his parents: "I live near the beach, I found a good place and stayed there". 
"But what kind of water you drink?" They asked. "I found any water and that is I drink, Haxhaxaha tahomisi", he said them while talking about the Tecomate Bay.</p> 

<p>According to this legend, the young hunter became the Constellation with Canopus at its centre caused by a conflict with his elder brother. 
It appears directly towards the south. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p> All this knowledge of Comca'ac people comes from prehispanic epoch, and it has prevailed through centuries, 
thanks to oral tradition and the strength of the community to colonization, at first, and his opposition to evangelization, later on.
Still today, it is possible to hear the stories and legends behind the naming of Constellations and the events on the sea and on the desert. 
With the recovery of these legends, by exercise of memory and lively events with his ancestors,
Arturo Morales Blanco give us a legacy that must be conserved for future generations: children, young people who will have in their own language, how and what to look for in the sky.</p>
