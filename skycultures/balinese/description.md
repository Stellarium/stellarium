# Balinese

## Introduction

Balinese people have had a strong connection to the cosmos since ancient times. They rely on the cosmos because they believe that every celestial body has power and will impact what they will or have done. Therefore, in carrying out all activities, from social to civil and ritual, they must know the right time to do so, guided by the celestial conditions.

## Description

Bali, one of the provinces in Indonesia, is a strategic island for cultural exchange, as the island is located between Java and Lombok Island. Most people recognize Bali as a tourist island; meanwhile, this refers to Bali Island, not Bali Province. Aside from Bali Island, Bali province has other small islands nearby, namely Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, Nusa Ceningan, Serangan, and Menjangan. The majority of Bali's population is Balinese Hindus, who are slightly different from Indian Hindus. They also have their own language, Balinese. Bali utilizes its territory as a primary source of income through tourism. However, before the 18th century, its inhabitants made their living in agriculture and fishing. Through the original lifestyle, they have a system for determining the right time to do rituals and live by interpreting the sky.

From its location, Balinese sky culture is one of the unique sky cultures in Indonesia due to its mixture of cultures. This sky culture has a mixture of influences from China and India through the religion transmission, Hindu-Buddhist, and trade. Polynesian influence existed earlier, given that Polynesians were accustomed to seafaring. Furthermore, it is known that most of the ancestors of Indonesians were sailors, which is supported by the fact that Indonesia is an archipelago.

<i>Cultural Map that influences Balinese Sky Culture</i>

In written form, Balinese sky culture is preserved in lontar or leaves of Borassus flabellifer or palmyra which is dried and used as a material for manuscript and antique crafts. This sky culture is related to Balinese calendar, and this system is Palelintangan. Palelintangan is a set of 35 asterisms that has a deep connection between cosmic movement and human life. Basically, they rely their daily activities based on which palelintangan is appear in that time. They believe each lintang of palelintangan has their own cosmos power to handle their work.

Palelintangan is formed by combining seven-day cycle (from Redite/Sunday to Saniscara/Saturday) and five-day cycle (from Umanis to Kliwon). Palelintangan adopted Nakṣatra system and combining with the earlier existing concept in Bali. From all 35-lintang, four of them could not be considered as constellation. They are lintang Laweyan, lintang Děpat, lintang Dupa and lintang Srengenge. 

### Sky

This sky culture has one small lintang system called "Kartika". You can see it clearly if you zoom into the Pleiades. 
Balinese people are gifted in art. They use art to admire the cosmos and the gods who guard it. Consequently, the constellations depicted in this culture are found not only on palm-leaf manuscripts but also on textiles sold in the marketplace. Furthermore, they also depict them on buildings such as the Floating Pavilion, used for royal gatherings, receiving guests, and ceremonial purposes.

### Moon and Sun

Bali has two distinct calendars: the Pawukon calendar and the Balinese Saka calendar.

The Pawukon calendar is a purely arithmetic calendar with a 210-day cycle, divided into 30 seven-day units called wuku. This calendar does not have a new year but begins with the Sinta wuku. This calendar is related to the Palelintangan system. Furthermore, most feast days in Bali are determined based on the Pawukon calendar.

Next is the Balinese Saka calendar, a Balinese Hindu lunisolar calendar with a normal year consisting of 12 months. The beginning of each month is determined by the new moon (called Tilem). The waxing phase of the moon is called Penanggal, and the waning phase is called Panglong. The difference in the number of days in the solar and lunar years results in an intercalation of 11 days, which is then added to form the 13th month every three years. The New Year is called Nyepi (Silence Day), the first day of the 10th month (Sasi Kadasa). It always falls on the day after Tilem, which is closest to (but after) the March equinox. Coupled with intercalation regulations, Nyepi is kept in the mid-March to mid-April Gregorian calendar.

For the civil calendar, in Indonesia, all regions are required to follow the national calendar. However, Bali has its calendars for religious rituals. The Balinese government eventually took the initiative to combine various calendar systems and adapt all Indonesian holidays to the one civil Balinese calendar. As a result, this calendar circulating in the community has become a complex one, consisting of the Saka Balinese calendar, the Pawukon calendar, the Saka Javanese calendar, the Chinese calendar, and the Japanese calendar. Therefore, a single date contains information from various calendar systems used in Bali.

### Other Celestial Objects

The Balinese consider comets to be stars, calling them lintang Dupa. Dupa is an incense. They think that comets are similar to incense. Furthermore, lintang Laweyan and lintang Děpat are unique. These two lintangs are related to the story of Kalau Rau, a powerful demon who stole the holy water (tirta amerta) that can make anybody immortality. His actions were discovered by the Sun God and Moon God. One of their weapons split the demon's head and body. His head is called lintang Laweyan, which in Vedic concept is associated with Rahu.  Meanwhile, his body is called lintang Děpat, which in Vedic concept is associated with Ketu. In astronomical concept, lintang Laweyan is the lunar ascending node, and the descending node is lintang Děpat.

## Authors

The Balinese sky culture were compiled and added to Stellarium by <em> Youla A Azkarrula: youlaafifahrvvl@gmail.com </em>. She is a researcher from Bali, Indonesia. She worked for this project based on her pre-doctoral research under supervision of Dr. Dr. Susanne M Hoffmann.

The paintings were repainted by: <em>Jessica Gullberg </em>. She is a great artist and illustrator, created numerous original pencil drawings, watercolor paintings, and illustrations of archaeological sites, cultural artifacts, and astronomical interpretations.

### About

This celestial culture is essentially already partially reflected in the Balinese calendar, which is published annually by the government. Later, in a seminar held by the Bali Museum, previous research by German ethnologist and explorer Alfred Maaß was presented.

Alfred Maaß made a report about his journey into an article titled "Astrologische Kalender der Balinesen"[#1]. In his article, he gave a description of each lintang in the Palelangan in the form of "Position in the Sky". But there are 10 lintangs that are not explained.

Then a team from the Bali Museum continued to study deeper about the Palelintangan for the ritual. Furthermore, they mentioned a little about lintang in the form of asterism. They explained that the X-star constellation was similar to the constellation Y (the constellation set by IAU).

With an explanation from the two main sources, we began to form Contellation Lines using Sky Culture Maker (SCM) from the description given, composed and triangulation. We have adjusted the full form of Contellation Lines to the images given by each lintang.

In anchoring the artwork, we chose to use the re-paint image from the existing sources with the condition that using older images and in accordance with the description given by the resource persons in the Maaß article. Based on the interviews we conducted with several people, namely Hindu Religious Instructors, Chair of the Bali Dharma Hindu Association and the seminar from Balinese astronomers, that the information contained in the Maaß manuscript can be used as a reference because this information comes from traditional leaders in Klungkung.
