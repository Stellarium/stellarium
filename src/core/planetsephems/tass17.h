The TASS 1.7 theory of the Saturnian satellites including HYPERION
by Alain VIENNE and Luc DURIEZ can be found at
ftp://ftp.imcce.fr/pub/ephem/satel/tass17

I (Johannes Gajdosik) have just taken the Fortran code and data
obtained from above and rearranged it into this piece of software.

I can neither allow nor forbid the usage of the TASS 1.7 theory.
The copyright notice below covers not the work of Alain VIENNE and Luc DURIEZ
but just my work, that is the compilation of the TASS 1.7 theory
into the software supplied in this file.

This is an implementation of the TASS 1.7 theory.
My modifications are:
1) do not calculate constant terms at runtime but beforehand
2) unite terms with the same frequencies
3) rearrange the terms so that calculation of the argument becomes easier
4) substitute so that the independent variable becomes T=jd-2444240
   for all satellites (including hyperion)
5) do not calculate a satellites "rmu" at runtime but beforehand
6) use a rotation matrix for Transformation to J2000
   instead of AIA, OMA and inclination of earth axis
7) exchange indices of hyperion and iapetus
8) calculate the orbital elements not for every new jd but rather reuse
   the previousely calculated elements if possible
