 *------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * "IP" and "Port" are used for ETH adapter configuration and are ignored in
 * USB variant.
 * Values in [driver] section are used by default and therefore are optional.
 * "ConnectTimeout" is used when driver is connecting to adapter (in
 * gxccd_enumerate_eth() or gxccd_initialize_eth()).
 * "SendTimeout" and "ReceiveTimeout" are used during communication with
 * adapter.
 * All these values apply in erroneous states (network failure, adapter failure,
 * etc.) and it is not necessary to change them.
 * "MicrometerFilterOffsets" is explained in the following section.
 * "ClearTime" is interval in seconds in which the driver periodically clears
 * the CCD chip. There is no need to change the default value (15 seconds).
 * If you want to use advanced USB functions below, you can turn this feature by
 * setting "ClearTime" to 0 or -1 and clear the CCD manualy with gxusb_clear().
 *------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Section [filters] is for G2/G3/G4 camera filter wheel configuration.
 * There is no way how to determine the actual filters in the filter wheel
 * automatically. You must create .ini file with this section.
 *
 * Every line in this section describes one filter position. Filter description
 * is a comma-separated list of three values:
 *
 *   1. Filter name:    This name is returned to the client application, which
 *                      can use it to list available filters in the filter wheel.
 *
 *   2. Filter color:   This color can be used by client application to display
 *                      the filter name with a color, hinting the filter type.
 *                      The color can be expressed by a name (see below) or
 *                      directly by decimal number representing the particular
 *                      color (0 is black, 16777215 (0xffffff) is white).
 *
 *   3. Filter offset:  Distance to move the focuser to refocus upon filter
 *                      change. Plan-parallel glass shifts the actual focus
 *                      position back for 1/3 of the glass thickness (exact
 *                      value depends on the glass refraction index, but for
 *                      almost all glasses 1/3 is very close to exact value).
 *                      Refocusing is useful when changing filters of different
 *                      thickness among exposures or when some exposures are
 *                      performed through filters and other without filters at
 *                      all.
 *
 * Posible filter color names are Red, LRed, Blue, LBlue, Green, LGreen, Cyan,
 * LCyan, Magenta, LMagenta, Yellow, LYellow, LGray, DGray, White, Black.
 *
 * Filter offsets can be defined in focuser dependent units (steps) or in
 * micrometers (Î¼m). If the micrometers are used, it is necessary to inform
 * driver by the "MicrometerFilterOffsets" parameter in the [driver] section
 * of the ini file. Value of the "MicrometerFilterOffsets" parameter can be
 * expressed as keywords "true" or "false" (default) as well as numbers 1 (for
 * true) or 0 (for false).
