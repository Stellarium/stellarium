"The Book of Fixed Stars was written shortly before 964 AD. Dr. Paul "
"Kunitzsch described it as \"the most outstanding among the works of the "
"prominent astronomer Abu 'l-Ḥusayn 'Abd al-Raḥmān ibn 'Umar al-Şūfi (born in"
" Rayy, 903; died 986), referred to as al-Sufi. In it, al-Şūfī treats the 48 "
"classical constellations, which were established and transmitted in "
"Ptolemy's Almagest. The description of each constellation comprises the "
"following four sections: first, a general discussion of the constellation "
"and its individual stars; this section also includes alŞūfi's criticism of "
"the Ptolemaic tradition and notices of his own observations. Second, a "
"record of the indigenous Arabic star names falling under that constellation,"
" and the exact identification of the respective stars with the corresponding"
" Ptolemaic stars. Third, two drawings of the constellation, one as it is "
"seen on a celestial globe, and the other one as it is seen in the sky. "
"Fourth, a table of the stars making up that constellation, giving a verbal "
"description of each star's location and its longitude, latitude, and "
"magnitude. This table closely follows the arrangement of Ptolemy's star "
"catalogue in the Almagest.\" <sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">[1]</a></sup>. In "
"addition to the four sections of each constellation mentioned by dr. "
"Kunitzsch, Al-Sufi would identify stars within the 6 magnitudes that were "
"neglected by Ptolemy, but he did not catalogue them and was faithful to "
"Ptolemy star catalog."

"An important aspect of the general discussion section is Al-Sufi method of "
"facilitating the star identification. He describes each individual star in "
"more than way: By the star position related to the constellation figure, by "
"its magnitude, by the asterism it forms with other stars like triangle or "
"arc shapes, sometimes by the star position related to the Milky way, and by "
"the angular distance from a close by star. I have counted more than 700 "
"angular distances measured by al-Sufi in his book. The units he uses for "
"angular distances are cubits, spear length, man-height, span, and finger. "
"Al-Sufi explicitly said in his book that a cubit is equal to two degrees and"
" 20 minutes <sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\">[2]</a></sup>. For the other units,"
" Schjellerup concluded some values, but tracking the 700 measurements, I "
"came up with different values. The following table summarizes the units and "
"relationship to the cubit value from Schjellerup<sup><a "
"href=\"#footnote-3\">[3]</a></sup> and from my research."

"Most astronomical observation in the Japan until the Meiji Restoration was "
"closely tied to astrological purposes.  For ancient Chinese and later Korean"
" and Japanese cartographers four seasons and four cardinal directions is "
"marked as four talismanic animals - the Azure Dragon of the East (Spring), "
"the Red Bird of the South (Summer), the White Tiger of the West (Fall), and "
"the \"Genbu\" (Black Tortoise) of the North (Winter). Corresponding to each "
"of the talismanic animals the celestial \"palaces\" were seven <em>sei "
"shuku</em> or what are sometimes called \"lunar lodges\".  The moon "
"\"stations\" or \"lodges\" probably may be used to determine position of sun"
" and planets as well as the moon, and their number may or may not have been "
"related to the period of the moon's orbit. Origins of these associations are"

" rituals or delivering particular messages to an audience (political and "
"sacred facts from rulers to the people, sculpted in monuments and stelae). "
"These records allow us explore, through the laborious work of many "

"元々チベット・モンゴルの占星術では肉眼で見える各惑星の位置を計算していました。土星の先の惑星は望遠鏡(彼らが占星術を作成したずっと後に現れた機器)なしでは見えないので、モンゴル人は曜日ごとに5つの惑星の1つを帰属させ、日曜日は太陽(ナル、<em>Nar</em>)、月曜日は月(サル、<em>Sar</em>)で終わっています。モンゴル語での太陽系惑星と冥王星の名前にはいくつかの特徴があります。水星はブド(<em>Bud</em>、水曜日と関連)、金星はスガル(<em>Sugar</em>、金曜日と関連)、地球はデルキイ(<em>>Delkhii</em>)、火星はアヌガラグ(<em>Angarag</em>、火曜日と関連)、木星はバルハスバディ(<em>Barhasbadi</em>、木曜日と関連)、土星はサンチル(<em>Sanchir</em>、土曜日と関連)、天王星はテンゲリイン=ヴァン(<em"

"van</em>)、とそれぞれ呼ばれています。最後の3つの天体は肉眼では見えず、他の惑星の後に長い間発見されておらず、名前の末尾にヴァ(<em>-van</em>)が付け加えられるという特徴があり、ヴァンはモンゴル語での王位を示しています。冥王星は最後にヴァンが付け加えられたことを除いて、地球と同様に命名されています。モンゴル語での冥王星は「王子の地」と翻訳することが可能ですが、この場合の「地」は私たちが歩き回る表面を意味する地面を表し、地球という意味ではありません。天王星のテンゲリイン=ヴァンは「王子の空」と訳せ、海王星のダライ=ヴァンは「王子の海」と訳せます。それでもこの接頭辞には英語で実際に相当するものはなく、上記の翻訳は惑星の名前の意味を理解するために提示されています。ただ、これら天体の名前はサンスクリット語(インドで話されている言語)に由来し、モンゴルでは現在でも主に使用されていますが、非公式な名称です。"

"一般に1年の短い期間での日没のように、その没が起きるとトゥカノ族の星座またはその一部が観察されると言えます。この天文現象に関連する自然現象はたくさんあります。たとえば、11月のアーニャ(Aña)の頭の没と、ティキエ(Tiquié)川の水位の増減との関係を検討できます。河川水位の変動はこれらの変化しやすい自然条件の結果として現れる異なる魚の出現を伴います。他のより大きな魚は複数の目的のために最初のグループに従います(例えばより小さな魚を食べるということ)。それらのすべては最終的に川面に落ちるいくつかの果物を食べます。地上の動物や微生物はその他の果物だけでなく、これらの果物にも興味を持っています。したがって、最初に私たちにとって天体の没として説明された現象は、この地域の周りのトゥカノ族とその近隣のより複雑な行動の中に見ることができます。動物、植物、そして精神的な出現も私たちがこれ以上無視できない宇宙論的な見方の下で複雑な関係にあります。"
