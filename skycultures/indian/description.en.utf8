<h2>Indian Vedic</h2>
<p>Vedic sky culture with some commonly known constellations related to Nakṣatra-s.</p>

<h3>Rāśi (राशिः)</h3>
<p>The sidereal zodiac is an imaginary belt of 360 degrees (like the tropical zodiac), divided into 12 equal parts. Each twelfth part (of 30 degrees) is called a sign or rashi. Their names are shown in (brackets).</p>

<h3>Nakṣatra (नक्षत्रम्)</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<ul>
<li>In Hindu tradition the ecliptic is divided into 27 parts of approximately 13\tfrac{1}{3}^o, which correspond with 27 asterisms known as the nakṣatra-s  (full list, with western equivalents here: https://goo.gl/2PVi28 ). In the earliest extant layers of the tradition this number is 28. This division is critical for several purposes including timing rituals and determining the birth lunar mansions. Since these asterisms define an area in the sky, they are also technically constellations.</li>
<li>sUrya-siddhAnta and vedAnga-jyotiSha specify start coordinates for the 13deg20 divisions using some stars (Please see penultimate paragraph in <a href="https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfCalendarPanchangaCommittee/History-of-Calendar-Panchanga-Committee#page/n42/mode/1up">this page</a>).
</li>
<li>A few of the yogatārā-s or prominent asterisms in the nakṣatra-s (going by their mainstream identification) lie slightly outside their constellation boundaries - in which case, any resultant problem (with regards to ritual timing or astrology) should be solved by other means (some people propose alternate identifications for such yogatārā-s).
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Attestation</h4>
<p>The earliest complete nakṣatra lists are found in the Taittirīya-śruti and the Atharvaveda where they are recited as part of the nakṣatreṣṭi ritual which places the deities of pantheon in these celestial compartments. Some scholars opine that the tradition shows that by the early medieval period, the nakṣatra identification had changed to a small degree from the Vedic period.</p>
<p>In mythology the Nakshatras are considered to be the 27 daughters of Dakṣa Prajāpati and wives of Chandra, the god of moon.</p>

<h4>Notation and depiction</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the core files, we use IAST transliteration.</li>
<li>Rāśi names are placed within ().</li>
<li>Nakṣatra names are placed within [], except for abhijit, which is placed in {}.</li>
<li>Some nakṣatra-s have no sky art, but 27 ecliptic longitudes need to be shown in order to effectively determine the current position of any celestial object (especially chandra or moon).</li>
