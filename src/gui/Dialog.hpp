//! \class BarFrame
//! A title bar control used in windows derived from StelDialog.
//! 
//! As window classes derived from StelDialog are basic QWidgets, they have no
//! title bar. A BarFrame control needs to be used in each window's design
//! to allow the user to move them.
//! 
//! Typically, the frame should contain a centered label displaying the window's
//! title and a button for closing the window (connected to the 
//! StelDialog::close() slot).
//! 
//! To use the default Stellarium style for title bars, the BarFrame object of a
//! given window should be named "TitleBar". See the normalStyle.css file for
//! the style sheet description.
