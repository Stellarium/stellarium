-------------------- STELLARIUM INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ---------------------

===============================================================================
                           BINARY INSTALLATION
===============================================================================
Most users will prefer using precompiled binary packages:

- WINDOWS USERS :
run setup.exe and follow the instructions.

- MACOSX USERS :
run stellarium.dmg

- LINUX USERS :
Look for the binary package matching your distribution.

              COMPILATION (and modification) from the SVN sources
===============================================================================
You can get the latest SVN snapshot (from sourceforge). However with this SVN
version no correct behaviour is guaranteed. It is mainly intended for use by
developers. 
You can browse the SVN tree from 

http://stellarium.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/stellarium/


For build instructions see these pages on the Stellarium wiki:

You can have a look at the src/ directory where you will find the source 
files.  Edit whatever you want in it and when your new great feature is done 
you will need to share it with the community of Stellarium developers.

At this point, an official developer just have to type svn commit to update 
the repository version. But as you are not an official developer (yet!) you 
will need to create a patch file which will contain all the changes you did 
on the source code.  

~$ cd directory-you-want-to-diff
~$ svn diff > mypatch.diff

You can now submit mypatch.diff on the sourceforge Stellarium page in the 
patches section (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=48857&atid=454375) 
with a clear comment on what is the patch doing.

A project member will then have a look at it and decide whether the patch is 
accepted or rejected for integration into Stellarium.
