COMPUTATION OF THE COORDINATES OF THE URANIAN SATELLITES (GUST86),
version 0.1 (1988,1995) by LASKAR J. and JACOBSON, R. can be found at
ftp://ftp.imcce.fr/pub/ephem/satel/gust86

I (Johannes Gajdosik) have just taken the Fortran code and data
obtained from above and rearranged it into this piece of software.

I can neither allow nor forbid the usage of the GUST86 theory.
The copyright notice below covers not the works of LASKAR J. and JACOBSON, R.,
but just my work, that is the compilation of the GUST86 theory
into the software supplied in this file.

My implementation of GUST86 has the following modifications:
1) Rotate results to "dynamical equinox and ecliptic J2000",
   the reference frame of VSOP87 and VSOP87A:
   The rotation matrix Gust86ToJ2000 can be derived from gust86.f,
   the rotation J2000ToVsop87 can be derived from vsop87.doc.
2) units used in calculations: julian day, AU, rad
3) use the same function EllipticToRectangular that I use in TASS17.
4) calculate the orbital elements not for every new jd but rather reuse
   the previousely calculated elements if possible

   WARNING! Due to static internal variables, this function is not reentrant and not parallelizable!

  /* Return the rectangular coordinates of the given satellite

     The origin of the xyz-coordinates is the center of the planet.
     The reference frame is "dynamical equinox and ecliptic J2000",
     which is the reference frame in VSOP87 and VSOP87A.

     According to vsop87.doc VSOP87 coordinates can be transformed to
     FK5 (=J2000=ICRF for our accuracy requirements) by
       X       cos(psi) -sin(psi) 0   1        0         0   X

     with psi = -0.0000275 degrees = -0.099 arcsec and
     eps = 23.4392803055556 degrees = 23d26m21.4091sec.

     http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons_doc.html#frames says:
       "J2000" selects an Earth Mean-Equator and dynamical Equinox of
       Epoch J2000.0 inertial reference system, where the Epoch of J2000.0
       is the Julian date 2451545.0. "Mean" indicates nutation effects are
       ignored in the frame definition. The system is aligned with the
       IAU-sponsored J2000 frame of the Radio Source Catalog of the
       International Earth Rotational Service (ICRF).
       The ICRF is thought to differ from FK5 by at most 0.01 arcsec.

     From this I conclude that in the context of stellarium
     ICRF, J2000 and FK5 are the same, while the transformation
     ICRF <-> VSOP87 must be done with the matrix given above.
