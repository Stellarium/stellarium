# Vanuatu (Netwar)

## Introduction

The Netwar sky culture for Stellarium stems from a research which is ran among the people of Vanuatu by Dominik M. Ramík and is [published online](http://dominicweb.eu/en/vanuatu-sky/). Netwar language (its indigenous name, also sometimes called "Lenakel language" after a major village in the area) is one of languages of Tanna island in Vanuatu. Its constellations are strikingly similar with other languages of Vanuatu, although names and meanings vary to some extent.
