Cross-identification of objects in consolidated DSO catalog was maked with:

     http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr
[2]  Merged catalogue of reflection nebulae (Magakian, 2003)

[3]  Messier Catalogue was taken from Wikipedia (includes morphological classification and distances)
     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Messier_objects
[4]  Caldwell Catalogue was taken from Wikipedia (includes morphological classification and distances)
