0.6.0b [26/07/2003]
Removed the previous patch to configure SDL because it caused some error on some systems.
Changed the global coordinate system into the conventionnal astronomical one (ie with z axis toward top and x toward us)
Stopped using the previous unreliable astro library with badly defined licence and use 2 libraries created from modified/simplified version of the LGPL library libnova. One called stellastro which manages the astronomical operations like time management etc. and another one called stellplanet which only computes the planetary positions.
Removed the module/class planet_mgr and use a hierarchical unified planet class instead to manage all the solar system bodies with objective to add planet satellites, asteroids, comete and manage planet obliquity, and rotation of the textures.
Remade in a coherent way all the s_utility conversion functions (in double precision).
Created a new class "stel_object" to manage the selected object in a good object oriented way.
Abandoned my previous vector class for a recreated version of the vecmath class (originally from celestia).
Use double precision for every planet, orbit and navigation calculation.
Centralized all the navigation/time variables and operations in a new class "navigator" instead of the non-object old navigation module.
The position of the observer on the earth is now taken into account in every calculation : the precision is dramaticaly improved, sun eclipses works etc...
Changed the command line handling : changes submitted by Cedric Delfosse.
Simplified 3D lighting operation for planets.
Fixed many many bugs related with coordinate.
Added an orbit calculation class borowed from the GPL soft celestia.
Added experimentaly jupiter satellites.
Improved object search and planets hints displaying.
Created a new class to render daylight atmosphere, with a faster and better algorithm.
Created a new class used to convert tone from high range luminance to CRT display luminance : the aim is to have an homogeneous luminance conversion to use with daylight sky as well as night sky and stars.
Changed the configuration file parser. The new one is much more convenient. It is called iniparser and it's made by N.Devillard.
Re-made the old ui widget classes in a better way using functor callbacks and painters.
Re-thinked and made all the interface. stel_ui is now correct object oriented code.
Added a tab widget.
Created a new class to complete the daylight atmosphere model with the previously used model.
Now display computed atmosphere moon halo and realistic night sky brightness.
The stars appear in function of the sky luminance.
Made a correct object oriented solarsystem class. The planets are read from a file.
Added some planet satellites.
Improved optimization using gprof.
Finally fixed the planet shaking bug!
Updated fog and decor displaying (faster and nicer)
Added a projector class which will handle different projection mode (fisheye, ortho etc..)

Added the CTRL + Up/Down keys to control the zoom.
Removed a lot of warnings which occured during the compilation on some plateforms.

Fixed orientation of the moon, improved rendering and make it visible during the day.

0.4.3 [16/01/2002]
Fixed a lot of minor bugs.
Compiled the new version with gcc/g++ on win32 and linux.
Reorganised the project files structure.

0.4.2 [15/01/2002]
Finished the full reorganisation : almost a weekend of work!
The program looks like the version 0.3.9 but the sources are infinitely more readable and clear.
Almost all the variable and file/class names are now in english.
Created/renamed a lot of new modules (navigation, stellarium_ui, etc...)
Added a GPL header on every sources files.
Globaly cleaned the code source.
Continued the gui.
Handle the Keyboard on the top of Glut.
Changed the drawing of the stars : 2D drawing is a lot faster and really only draw those which are in the field of view. The program is 20% faster!!
We now can't switch between resolution mode or fullscreen/windowed mode during the execution. This will prevent the program from crashs and hardware dependent bugs. Everything is statically configurable in config.txt. 
Fixed hundred of minor bugs (and probably added others...).
I now have written about 4300 lines of real code for this project!

0.4.1 [13/01/2002]

Continued the gui. Now use it for every interaction with the user.
Handle the Mouse on the top of Glut : I'd like the program to be glut independent.
The program use a file stellarium.h with a lot of macro, commons include ect...
Encapsuled all the global variables in the struct "global" shared bye every module.
This version has never worked.

0.4.0.1 [07/01/2002]
Added a real manager to use a config file. I have found an excellent library made by NINOMIYA <gm@debian.or.jp> called parsecfg.c. I included it with success (minor changes for windows porting).
Continued the gui : added classes like windows and label and a full implementation of callbacks.
Started to change the structure of the program.

0.4.0 [06/01/2002]
Started to write my own Graphic User Interface starting from the embryon of the one made by Chris Laurel in "Celestia" because MUI (given with the glut package isn't beautiful enought...). This gui will be independent of stellarium and very re-usable.
Did an attempt to use a tcl parser to manage a real config file but it was to heavy-> so i changed my mind and stop that... 

0.3.9 [04/01/2002]
Create my own font manager : faster and more beautiful than before (I used bitmap font before).
Handle the change of resolution (reduce the menu, the font etc...)

Translate the help in english.
Fixed minor bugs and visuals.

0.3.4 [17/06/2001] : 
Fixed the bug for the selection, improve global perfomance, and continue to comment the code.

0.3.3 [Before] : 
I succed to compile my program in linux and windows with the same sources files ! 
I decided to share my source code in GPL. 
My code was yet free but not very "readable" so i will try to comment it in english, and to make a version file (this file) etc... I now have to read docs to produce a "standard GNU code"...
