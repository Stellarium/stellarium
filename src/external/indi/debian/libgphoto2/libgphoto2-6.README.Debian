Using libgphoto2 as a normal user
---------------------------------

This version of libgphoto2-installs udev files in /lib/udev/rules.d/ to
allow camera access to all members of group 'plugdev'.

This means the only configuration is to add authorized users to the 'plugdev'
group.  Note that group changes will only apply when you relog.

udev may fail to set group ownership for cameras that are not explicitly known
by gphoto2, if you know your camera is a generic PTP model not handled by udev,
you can create a file in /etc/udev/rules.d/, say z25_my_camera.rules, with such
a content:

ACTION=="add", SYSFS{idVendor}=="XXXX", SYSFS{idProduct}=="YYYY", \
  MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"

You can get XXXX and YYYY value with lsusb, for example:

  Bus 001 Device 010: ID 04a9:3125 Canon, Inc.
                         ^^^^ ^^^^
			 XXXX YYYY

You can also send the USB ID as a Debian bug report or to gphoto2 development
mailing list at gphoto-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

Note: before 2.2.1-9, the group was not 'plugdev' but 'camera'.
