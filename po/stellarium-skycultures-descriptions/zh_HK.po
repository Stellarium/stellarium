"Anuta is a tiny volcanic island which, though located within the Solomon "
"Islands of Melanesia, is populated by Polynesians. Stars provide the "
"Anutans' most important tool for long range navigation. Major guiding stars "
"and constellations are known as 'kaavenga'. Star paths that are followed "
"from one island to the next (even if they have not risen, or already set) "
"are called 'kau panogna porau'. Unnamed stars which are not used as major "
"navigational aids are called 'petuu vare' (foolish, common, or "
"undistinguished)."

msgid ""
"The Book of Fixed Stars was written shortly before 964 AD. Dr. Paul "
"Kunitzsch described it as \"the most outstanding among the works of the "
"prominent astronomer Abu 'l-Ḥusayn 'Abd al-Raḥmān ibn 'Umar al-Şūfi (born in "
"Rayy, 903; died 986), referred to as al-Sufi. In it, al-Şūfī treats the 48 "
"classical constellations, which were established and transmitted in "
"Ptolemy's Almagest. The description of each constellation comprises the "
"following four sections: first, a general discussion of the constellation "
"and its individual stars; this section also includes alŞūfi's criticism of "
"the Ptolemaic tradition and notices of his own observations. Second, a "
"record of the indigenous Arabic star names falling under that constellation, "
"and the exact identification of the respective stars with the corresponding "
"Ptolemaic stars. Third, two drawings of the constellation, one as it is seen "
"on a celestial globe, and the other one as it is seen in the sky. Fourth, a "
"table of the stars making up that constellation, giving a verbal description "
"of each star's location and its longitude, latitude, and magnitude. This "
"table closely follows the arrangement of Ptolemy's star catalogue in the "
"Almagest.\" [#1]. In addition to the four sections of each constellation "
"mentioned by dr. Kunitzsch, Al-Sufi would identify stars within the 6 "
"magnitudes that were neglected by Ptolemy, but he did not catalogue them and "
"was faithful to Ptolemy star catalog."

"An important aspect of the general discussion section is Al-Sufi method of "
"facilitating the star identification. He describes each individual star in "
"more than way: By the star position related to the constellation figure, by "
"its magnitude, by the asterism it forms with other stars like triangle or "
"arc shapes, sometimes by the star position related to the Milky way, and by "
"the angular distance from a close by star. I have counted more than 700 "
"angular distances measured by al-Sufi in his book. The units he uses for "
"angular distances are cubits, spear length, man-height, span, and finger. Al-"
"Sufi explicitly said in his book that a cubit is equal to two degrees and 20 "
"minutes [#2]. For the other units, Schjellerup concluded some values, but "
"tracking the 700 measurements, I came up with different values. The "
"following table summarizes the units and relationship to the cubit value "
"from Schjellerup[#3] and from my research.\n"

"Another important aspect of Al-Sufi book is his record of the indigenous "
"Arabic star names falling under each constellation, and the exact "
"identification of the respective stars with the corresponding Ptolemaic "
"stars. This means that we are looking at two layers of stars knowledge at "
"the same time: the Ptolemaic one and the indigenous Arab one.\n"
"\n"
"### The Sky Culture\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture is a result of a research done on several manuscripts of "
"the book, oldest of which is the [#8].\n"
"\n"
"First, the manuscripts of the Book of Fixed Stars were critically edited, "
"and the text was produced. Second, each member star of the 48 constellations "
"was identified according to Al-Sufi description, and new tables were built "
"including modern star designations from the Hipparcos, Bright stars, and "
"Bayer catalogues. Third, Arab indigenous star names were collected and "
"identified as mapped by Al-Sufi to the Ptolemaic ones. All the previous "
"steps were included in a book published digitally of the Book of Fixed Stars "
"plus explanations and commentary by Khalid Al-Ajaji[#4].\n"
"\n"
"The sky culture stick figures of the constellations are the images in the "
"Ulugh Beg manuscript of the Book of Fixed Stars, extracted, and adapted for "
"Stellarium by Mr. Kutaibaa Akraa [#5]. The star names file includes the star "
"number in the constellation as the primary star name and the description of "
"the star in the tables as a secondary name. For example, Polaris primary "
"name that is displayed with the star is: UMi1, UMi being Ursa Minor and 1 is "
"the first star of this constellation. If the star is selected other "
"secondary names are displayed, which will display \"The star on the end of "
"the tail\" on the top of the screen. The constellation lines are constructed "
"according to the constellation shapes with an attempt to include most of the "
"member stars. For indigenous Arab star knowledge, individual star names were "
"added to the star file as secondary names, while names of group of stars "
"were defined through asterism names and asterism lines files.\n"
"\n"
"The translation of star descriptions from Arabic into English was extracted "
"from Ernie Wright website[#6] which was transcribed from Toomer's "
"translation of the Almagest[#7]. The translation was modified in a few "
"places to agree with Al-Sufi wording.\n"
"\n"
"The single source of the sky culture is the Book of Fixed Stars and the "
"objective is to give a faithful representation of the book content."

"<p>\n"
"The Arabian Peninsula is a region covering the south western corner of Asia, "
"bordered by Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea on the south, Gulf of Oman and "
"Persian Gulf on the East, The Red Sea on the west. The northern border is "
"not well defined but according to ancient geographers, it is bordered by "
"rivers, meaning The Euphrates river [#16] [#17]. This region is inhabited by "
"Arabs and covers Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab "
"Emirates, Oman, Yemen, and parts of Syria and Iraq.\n"
"<p><img width=\"300\" src=\"illustrations/arabian_peninsula.jpg\" /></p>\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"The Bedouins and farmers in the Arabian Peninsula relied heavily on stars "
"for timing their nomadic trips, animal care, weather forecast and "
"agricultural activities. We find frequent mention of stars in their proverbs "
"and poetry. Fortunately, the oral poetry and proverbs have been documented "
"and preserved in collections by different scholars. Surveying these "
"collections along with oral traditions reveals the star knowledge of the "
"people of this region.\n"
"\n"
"The stars used for timing are the same as that of ancient Arabs, but the "
"system is simplified by beginning the year cycle with the heliacal rising of "
"al-Thurayyā, the Pleiades, in the beginning of summer, and then counting 13 "
"days for each lunar station, except for al-Ǧabhah that has 14 days. This "
"will have 27 lunar stations x 13 days + 14 days (al-Ǧabhah) = 365-day cycle. "
"Other methods of timing were used like the monthly Pleiades-Moon conjunction "
"or using other stars like the stars of the Big Dipper.\n"
"\n"
"The sources show that star names and asterisms are few compared to that of "
"ancient Arabs. Only the bright stars and prominent asterism were named and "
"used. An important source of star knowledge that continued its influence up "
"to the present is the poetry of al-Ḫalāwī, a poet who's time is not certain "
"but estimated to be in the 17th century[#3]. Another important source is a "
"poem by Moḥammad al-Qāḍī (~1809 -1886), where he described all the 28 lunar "
"stations, citing them by the local names[#2].\n"
"\n"
"#### Sources of Star Names and Asterisms\n"
"\n"
"The source of this sky culture is a compilation of star names from oral "
"traditions and the following books: [#2], [#3], [#5], [#6], [#8], [#11], "

"#### Historical Overview\n"
"\n"
"Originally, *Manāzil al-Qamar*, the Arabic for the lunar mansions, or "
"stations of the moon, were a system of 28 stars, group of stars, or spots in "
"the sky near which the moon can be found in each of the 28 nights of its "
"monthly revolution. Early mentions of the complete list of the lunar "
"stations are reported by ʿAbd al-Malik ibn Ḥabīb (d. 852) on the authority "
"of Mālik ibn Anas (d. 795) [#1]. However, this system had been adopted "
"already in the pre-Islamic period, prior to the 7th century of the common "
"era.\n"
"\n"
" Using heliacal observations, the asterisms of the lunar mansions served to "
"divide the sidereal and solar year of 365 days into 28 periods of 13 days "
"each except for one period that is given 14 days. These 28 periods are "
"called *Anwāʾ*, plural of *nawʾ*. Each *Nawʾ* is determined by a "
"characteristical star: when this star rises in the morning during dawn (in "
"the east, so, shortly before the Sun), this is the beginning of the next "
"*nawʾ*. The name of the *nawʾ* (period of time, half month), gives the lunar "
"mansion its name. One complete cycle of setting and rising for each of the "
"28 lunar mansions, one after the other, makes a solar year. This system was "
"used to determine the seasons and predict weather, especially rain [#2]. The "
"Arabs said: each *nawʾ* (period of 13/14 days) is characterized by a "
"distinctive weather pattern of rain, wind, and temperature [#3].\n"
"\n"
"A detailed description of the stars of each lunar mansion, the times of "
"their heliacal rising and a compilation of astronomical and meteorological "
"knowledge of the ancient Arabs can be found in the *Book of meteorology* "
"(Arabic: Kitāb al-anwāʾ), authored by Ibn Qutaybah (b. 828 - d. 884 or 889). "
"Copies of this book manuscripts survived, and it was printed in India in "
"1956 [#4].\n"
"\n"
" The usage of the lunar mansions continued to schedule the times of "
"agricultural, travel and medicine practices. Due to the importance of "
"observing the times of their heliacal risings, short treatises have been "
"written, and poems have been composed describing the asterisms of the 28 "
"mansions. A poem dedicated to description of the stars of the lunar mansions "
"was published by Gustave-Adolphe de Calassanti-Motylinski in 1899 in his "
"book *Les mansions lunaires chez les Arabes*, attributed to Muḥammad al-"
"Maqri (1578-1638) [#5][#6]. A sample treatise is the one written by Shaikh "
"Ṣāliḥ al-Shethrī (d. ~1891), titled *A time-table for farmers* [#7].\n"
"\n"
"#### Current Usage of Lunar Stations\n"
"\n"
" Agricultural almanacs based on the heliacal rising of lunar stations are "
"still in active use today. The official calendar of Saudi Arabia includes "
"these times [#8]. The following is an example of the use of a calendar based "
"on the lunar stations for the 13 days period starting with the rise of the "
"3rd lunar station *al-Thurayya* (Pleiades) on June 7th [#9]:\n"
"\n"
"> Weather gets hotter and wind gets stronger. Wild grasses dry. Water in "
"wells gets shallower. Rain is rare during this time. Spring insects start to "
"disappear. Palm tree dates starts to get its colors. It is recommended to "
"irrigate trees with the right amounts and stop irrigation of vines when "
"grapes start to get its color.\n"
"\n"
"#### Identification of the Lunar Stations\n"
"\n"
"Ibn Qutaybah (b. 828 - d. 884 or 889) in his book *Kitāb al-anwāʾ* gives "
"detailed description of the stars of each lunar station while an accurate "
"identification can be extracted from the *Book of Stars* by al-Sufi (d. "
"986). In his book, al-Sufi maps the stars known to ancient Arabs to those of "
"the Ptolemaic Constellations. An example of al-Sufi definitions of the stars "
"of the lunar mansions, here is the definition of *al-Ġafr* [#10][#11]:\n"
"\n"
"> And the 22nd [star of Virgo] and the 23rd which is on the tail [hem of the "
"garment] with the 25th on the left foot [of Virgo] are named [by the Arabs] "
"*al-Ghafr* which is the 15th lunar mansion.\n"
"\n"
" Because the stars of the Ptolemaic constellations have known coordinates, "
"it is relatively easy to identify the Arab star names.\n"
"\n"

"##### The Super lion and al-Ǧawzāʾ figures of the ancient Arab star lore\n"
"\n"
" One may notice from the names of the 7th to the 15th lunar stations that "
"they are part of a lion figure. This Arab lion figure covers around 100 "
"degrees, a little bit more than half of the sky dome. From the names of "
"these stars a lion figure can be constructed.\n"
"\n"
" Two of the lunar stations, *al-Haqʿah* and *al-Hanʿah*, are part of al-"
"Ǧawzāʾ stars. al-Ǧawzāʾ is the figure covering Orion plus some stars around "
"it. The ancient Arabs imagined these stars as a figure of a woman with a bow "
"and arrow aimed at the lion (an image, probably influenced from Roman Egypt: "
"see depiction on Denderah zodiac which shows Babylonian as well as Greek "
"traces of constellations). Mr. Roland Laffitte discussed these two figures "
"and offered a depiction of each in his article: [Our Arab Heritage in the "
"CelestialVault](http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/our-arab-heritage-"
"celestial-vault). A more detailed discussion of ancient Arab star lore is "
"found in his book: &quot;Le Ciel des Arabes&quot; [#12]."

"The cave of Armintxe was lost because of the urban development. On May first "
"2016, the group of speleology ADES entered in the cave and found a "
"spectacular panel of Magdalenian engravings, they are supposed to be done "
"between 12.000 to 17.000 BP, the engravings are a kind of cave art that "
"normally is very difficult to see, they are sometimes almost invisible, "
"located deep in the cave. This panel is more visible than others, and if you "
"have a lateral light, the vision is very impressive."

"\n"
"One year later, one of the speleologists, the photographer, was studying the "
"pictures and found out that the main panel depicted the starry firmament, "
"the engravings were like a Paleolithic planetarium, and the animals were "
"their constellations. Armintxe depicts the spring equinox.\n"
"\n"
"If you want to see the constellations at the same position than in the cave "
"you can use this settings: GPS coordinates:43°21′43″N 2°30′29″W, date: "
"-10500-6-10, hour:6am, you have to choose the art layer, they are the "
"original pictures of the cave, the constellation layer is not so important "
"in this case, tries to copy the original pictures. A twenty inch monitor or "
"bigger is needed. Some of the images are easy to see on an objective way, "
"like the tail of the lion and the second ibex, and the position between each "
"other prove that the mere coincidence is impossible. There are other "
"pictures almost impossible too see, their shape is very subjective, it looks "
"like the artists were trying to find in the stars these animals to complete "
"their calendar in a forced way.\n"
"\n"
"Another characteristic of Paleolithic constellations is that they use very "
"dim stars not the brightest, it looks like they were finding a hidden "
"message in the stars."

"both agricultural and sacred cycles. However, great part of this knowledge "
"was lost as consequence of the Spanish conquest which occurred on "
"continental America in the 16th century.</p>\n"
"<p>The elements of the Aztec society such as culture, economy and science is "

"destroyed, their main feature is that their where drawn in many different "
"materials such as deer skin, <em>amate</em> paper or cotton fabric and they "

"Mesoamerican customs continued prior to the Spanish conquest thanks to the "
"work of some native indians and some Spanish priests, this codexes are known "

"### Zodiac\n"
"\n"
"<p>The zodiac definitely came to Greece from Babylonian source.\n"
"It is not preserved when it had been invented there and when it was "
"transformed to Greek mathematical astronomy.\n"
"We know for sure that Hipparchus (2nd ct. BCE) cites ecliptical longitudes "
"from Eudoxus (4th ct. BCE)\n"
"with a zodiac divided into 12x30 units, equaling our 360°. These direct "
"citations from the 4th century BCE\n"
"suggest a much earlier invention because the concept of the zodiac of 360° "
"was very likely well established\n"
"in Babylonian mathematical astronomy before it was copied by Greek "
"mathematicians.\n"
"Taking Eudoxus' writing as a <em>terminus ante quem</em>, we extrapolate a "
"date for the genesis of the zodiac in Mesopotamia before 400 BCE.\n"
"In other fragments of mathematical astronomy (between 800 and 700 BCE) the "
"concept of the zodiac is not present.\n"
"Some scholars argue for the 6th century BCE as date of invention - but to be "
"honest, we don't know.\n"
"The common sense is that the zodiac was probably invented around the middle "
"of the 1st millennium BCE.</p>\n"
"\n"
"In MUL.APIN, there is definitely no zodiac but a predecessor: the path of "
"the Moon.\n"
"There are lists of constellations or \"gods who stand in the path of the "
"Moon,\n"
"through whose region the Moon during a month [passes repeatedly] and keeps "
"touching them.\"\n"
"(cited from the edition by Hunger and Steele, 2018, p. 143).\n"
"This list of the MUL.APIN compendium is not considered in this sky culture; "
"constellations in the path of the Moon are not highlighted.\n"
"\n"
"### Planets\n"
"\n"
"<p>This sky culture was made more or less only with the first list of the "
"compendium, the so called `star catalogue'.\n"
"It is not a real star catalogue because it does not give a single coordinate "
"and most of the names given there\n"
"are names of asterisms or constellations (and not point-like objects such as "
"stars). The text of this first list is reproduced below - yet, we layouted "
"it as a table to emphasis its function as an explanatory list. The catalogue "
"also includes the names of planets: of course, planets do not have a fixed "
"position.\n"
"However, in Mesopotamian culture it was common to mention them for a "
"complete set of objects in the sky.\n"
"They are usually denoted (or drawn) at the position of their exaltation "
"point (one of the later Greek <em>hypsomata</em> -\n"
"but Greek astrology provided two <em>hypsomata</em> per planet while "
"Babylonian had only one).</p>\n"
"\n"
"The names of the planets displayed in Stellarium are names of the objects in "
"the sky and not of the gods associated with them.\n"
"The list below shows that almost every asterism was associated with a "
"deity.\n"
"According to Babylonian belief, a deity has two representations: one in the "
"sky and one on Earth as statue in the temple.\n"
"That means a celestial object `is' not the deity but only one of its "
"possible expressions. This is also the case for the planets.\n"
"For instance, even a millennium before MUL.APIN, the goddess of sexual love "
"and desire as well as goddess of war,\n"
"the Sumerian Inanna/ Akkadian Ishtar had been associated with the planet "
"Venus.\n"
"This goddess was later `translated' to the Greek Aphrodite and Roman Venus "
"and even in the Greco-Roman culture the name of the planet\n"
"was Phosphoros (Greek: the Luminous One) or Lucifer (Latin: the Bringer of "
"Light) but associated with the goddess.\n"
"Similar cases exist for most of the constellations and single stars listed "
"in MUL.APIN.\n"
"\n"
"In the list reproduced below, the left column gives the name of the object "
"in the sky and the right column (in most of the cases) gives the associated "
"deity.\n"
"\n"
"### Star Catalogue\n"
"\n"
"The following table copies the reconstruction of the text of MUL.APIN by "
"Hermann Hunger+ (1989, 2018),\n"
"gives translations by Manfred Krebernik (published at the Rencontre "
"Assyriologique International, Innsbruck, 2018) and\n"
"identifies the Akkadian words with celestial regions and constellations "
"(work by Susanne M. Hoffmann, 2015-2018, presented at Deutsche Orientalisten-"
"Tagung, Jena, 2017).\n"

msgid ""
"The Seleucid Era in Babylonian history is the era of the successors of "
"Alexander the Great who conquered Babylon in 331 BCE. In these days MUL.APIN "
"(already thousand years old) was still copied and, thus, appears to have "
"developed to be an old-fashioned but not outdated standard. Moreover, there "
"is no alternative compendium like MUL.APIN from the Late Babylonian epoch.\n"
"\n"
"<p>This <em>Seleucid</em> or <em>Late Babylonian sky culture</em> is "
"supposed to show the (estimated) state of Babylonian constellations "
"contemporary to the Greek culture. There is no description of the full sky. "
"Changes with regard to the MUL.APIN version have certainly applied in the "
"zodiac since several centuries. This can be stated for sure because in this "
"time, there is a blossoming zodiacal astrology. Since there had been no "
"zodiac in MUL.APIN and the zodiac developed around the middle of the -1st "
"millennium, in the 2nd half of the 1st millennium BCE, there had been "
"different versions of the constellations around the ecliptic.\n"
" </p>\n"
"\n"
" However, we do not know much about the rest of the sky. Hence, for the "
"constellations far away from the zodiac, again the constellations of MUL."
"APIN can be taken as state of the art. Please see MUL.APIN sky culture for "
"more information and use the MUL.APIN constellations for an impression of "
"the Old Babylonian (or Middle Babylonian) sky culture."

"### Single Stars\n"
"\n"
" <p>\n"
" In contrast to constellations, there are much more lists of single stars "
"preserved from the later epochs. We use this Late Babylonian or Seleucid sky "
"culture to focus on the single star names. There are plenty of <i>ziqpu</i> "
"lists (lists of culminating stars) and for measurements in the zodiac, "
"\"normal stars\" have been introduced. Normal stars (from Latin \"norma\" = "
"the measure) are a frame of reference for mathematical astrometry of the "
"Late Babylonian epoch. While for most of the other stars the margin of error "
"concerning their identification with a celestial counterpart is sometimes "
"huge, the normal stars are identified properly because their coordinates can "
"be derived from the planets standing next to them (Jones, 2004).\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"### Source(s)\n"
"\n"
"<p>The lists of ziqpu stars and normal stars are mostly compiled from the "
"modern compendium Hunger and Pingree: Astral Science in Mesopotamia, 1999 "
"and some of the other papers given in \"Further Reading\". The book by "
"Hoffmann, 2017 already contains several computations with these stars and "
"more literature (e.g. Wayne Horowitz has worked on <i>ziqpu</i> stars for "
"many years but is not mentioned here with a special paper although his "
"translations contributed a lot for this study). A likely version of the Late "
"Babylonian stick figures will be added in a later release of Stellarium.\n"

"One hundred and forty years ago, a Boorong family at Lake Tyrrell (North-"
"Western Victoria, Australia) told William Stanbridge something of their "
"stories relating to the night sky. Some forty stars, constellations and "
"other celestial phenomena were named and located. He wrote them down and "
"related this information to the Philosophical Institute in Melbourne in "
"1857. In his paper he wrote down the Aboriginal term and gave its European "
"equivalent. What John Morieson has done is look closely at these celestial "
"phenomena, attempt to satisfactorily identity them and to imitate the way "
"the Boorong people may have seen them. John's interpretation was used to "
"create the constellation figures in Stellarium.\n"

"Astronomical* (Chinese: 仪象考成续编; pinyin: Yíxiàngkǎochéng xùbiān). "
"*Complete Studies of Astronomical* is an imperial record of astronomy "
"finished in 1756. In 1844, the Imperial Astronomical Observatory made a "
"revision to it and published *The Continuation of Complete Studies of "
"Astronomical*, which is the major reference to the traditional Chinese "
"Xingguans and star names used today. Yi Shitong has conducted textual "
"research and summary of these records in his book*Chinese and Western "
"Contrast Star Chart and Catalogue 1950.0* (Chinese: 中西对照恒星图表1950.0; "
"pinyin: Zhōngxī Duìzhào Héngxīng Túbiǎo).\n"

"and Western Contrast Star Chart and Catalogue 1950.0* and *Complete Studies "
"of Astronomical*.\n"
"\n"
"In addition, some stars have been added according to *The History of Stellar "
"Observation in China* (Chinese: 中国恒星观测史; pinyin: Zhōngguó Héngxīng "
"Guāncèshǐ) by Pan Nai, if these stars are not certified in *Chinese and "

"\n"
"If the star name is followed by a \"?\", it is a star added according to "

"certified.\n"
"\n"
"### Sun, Moon and Planets\n"
"\n"
"The Western countries named the planets in mythical characters. The ancient "
"Chinese understanding of five planets is based on five-element concepts. "
"Therefore, Mercury is named Water Star, Venus is named Metal Star, Mars is "
"named Fire Star, Jupiter is named Wood Star, Saturn is named Earth Star.\n"
"\n"
"In Chinese, the sun and the moon are named after Yin and Yang (with prefix "
"\"great\" (Chinese:太; pinyin: tài)), respectively Taiyang (Sun, Chinese: 太"
"阳; pinyin: Tàiyáng) and Taiyin (Moon, Chinese:太阴; pinyin: Tàiyīn). Their "
"other name belongs to pictographic characters. Ri (Sun, Chinese: 日) And Yue "
"(Moon, Chinese: 月). But the more commonly used name for the moon is "
"Yueliang (Chinese: 月亮; pinyin: Yuèliàng).\n"
"\n"
"The sun, the moon and the five planets form Seven Luminaries (Chinese: 七曜; "
"pinyin: qīyào), which correspond to the Five Elements and Yin and Yang.\n"
"\n"
"### Xingguans\n"
"\n"
"Traditional Chinese astronomy has a system of dividing the celestial sphere "
"into asterisms or constellations, known as \"Xingguan\". Modern "
"constellations refer to specific areas of the celestial sphere. Xingguans "
"refer only to the way stars are distributed, with no specific boundaries "
"between Xingguans.\n"
"\n"
"The name and layout of the Xingguans are very social, the kingdom, the "
"mountains, the goods, the industry all move to the sky, according to the "
"Earth's way in the sky to copy a world.\n"
"\n"
"The Xingguans are generally smaller than the constellations of Hellenistic "
"tradition. A Xingguan contain more than dozens of stars, and fewer are only "
"one. Medieval Chinese Astronomical Maps generally show a total of 283 "
"Xingguans, comprising a total of 1,464 individual stars. The Xingguans are "
"divided into 31 regions, the Twenty-Eight Mansions (Chinese: 二十八宿；"
"pinyin: Èrshíbā Xiù) along the ecliptic, and the Three Enclosures (Chinese: "
"三垣; pinyin: Sānyuán) of the northern sky. Due to the influence of "
"precession, six Xingguans near the southern horizon are getting more and "
"more south. They were no longer easy to be observed by astronomers in the "
"Ming and Qing Dynasties, so they were no longer recorded in *Complete "
"Studies of Astronomical*.\n"
"\n"
"Before the late Ming Dynasty (17th century), there were no Xingguans around "
"the southern celestial pole. The Southern Sky (Chinese: 近南极星区; pinyin: "
"JìnnánJí Xīngqū) was added as a 32th region in the late Ming Dynasty based "
"on European star charts, comprising an additional 23 Xingguans. The Southern "
"Sky are now also treated as part of the traditional Chinese system.\n"
"\n"
"Since the late Ming Dynasty, Western missionaries entered the Imperial "
"Astronomical Observatory. They have followed the names of the Xingguans, but "
"changed the corresponding stars of some Xingguans, and added some stars to "
"almost every Xingguan, called \"added stars\" (Chinese: 增星; pinyin: "
"zēngxīng). The original stars are called \"primary stars\" (Chinese: 正星; "
"pinyin: zhèngxīng). A Xingguan of two or more stars, each star has a number. "
"The name of the stars in *The Continuation of Complete Studies of "
"Astronomical* is the Xingguan plus a number. But there are also a few "
"Xingguans, each star has a special name.\n"
"\n"
"In this way, *The Continuation of Complete Studies of Astronomical* has 300 "
"Xingguans and 3240 stars in total.\n"
"\n"
"Until the Revolution of 1911, China no longer regarded Xingguan as the "
"official constellation system. Unlike Xingguans, traditional Chinese star "
"names are still used in modern Chinese astronomy, even more common than "
"Western names.\n"

"Three Enclosures is three regions in the northern sky surrounded by the "
"ecliptic. Three Enclosures is Purple Forbidden Enclosure (Chinese: 紫微垣; "
"pinyin: Zǐwēiyuán), Supreme Palace Enclosure (Chinese: 太微垣; pinyin: "
"Tàiwēiyuán), Heavenly Market Enclosure (Chinese: 天市垣; pinyin: "
"Tiānshìyuán).\n"
"\n"
"Each Enclosure has two walls, called the left wall and the right wall which "
"are the main Xingguans. The walls are surrounded by many Xingguans. There "
"are also Xingguans in the vicinity of the wall that belong to this "
"Enclosure.\n"
"\n"
"Purple Forbidden enclosure is the inner palace of the emperor, it covers the "
"northernmost area of the night sky. From the viewpoint of the ancient "
"Chinese, the Purple Forbidden Enclosure lies in the middle of the sky and is "
"circled by all the other stars. It covers the modern constellations Ursa "
"Minor, Draco, Camelopardalis, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Auriga, Boötes, and parts "
"of Ursa Major, Canes Venatici, Leo Minor, Hercules. Purple Forbidden "
"enclosure has 37 Xingguans.\n"

"Supreme Palace Enclosure is the place where the emperor and the courtiers "

"officials and government agencies. It covers the modern constellations "
"Virgo, Coma Berenices and Leo, and parts of Canes Venatici, Ursa Major and "
"Leo Minor. Supreme Palace Enclosure has 20 Xingguans.\n"

"Serpens, Ophiuchus, Aquila and Corona Borealis, and parts of Hercules. "

"### Twenty-Eight Mansions\n"
"\n"
"The Twenty-Eight Mansions (Chinese: 二十八宿; pinyin:Èrshíbā Xiù) also known "
"as 28 Lunar Mansions are the ancient China divisions of the ecliptic and the "
"sky area near the equator to divide the ecliptic into 28 regions according "
"to the right ascension. Each region is called a Mansion (Chinese: 宿; pinyin:"
"Xiù), The ancients let the Moon change a Mansion every day to rest.\n"
"\n"
"Each Mansion has a Xingguan of the same name near the ecliptic, which is the "
"main Xingguan. Where the Xingguans in this area belongs to the Mansion.\n"
"\n"
"Each Xingguans has a main star know as determinative star (Chinese: 距星; "
"pinyin: jùxīng). In ancient China, the determinative stars of Twenty-eight "
"Mansions was the benchmark for determining the longitude of the equatorial "
"coordinate system. The right ascension difference between the determinative "
"stars of two adjacent Mansions is the equatorial mansion degrees (Chinese: 宿"
"度; pinyin: xiùdù) of the western Mansion. The traditional equatorial "
"coordinate system of China divides the equator into 365.25 degrees, and the "
"Sun runs one day for one degree, which is also the sum of the equatorial "
"mansion degrees of the 28 Mansion.\n"
"\n"
"Due to the influence of precession, the equatorial mansion degrees of each "
"Mansion has been slowly changing, and some determinative stars have also "
"changed in history.\n"
"\n"
"On traditional Chinese star maps, there are 28 lines passing through the "
"determinative stars of The Twenty-Eight Mansions from the north celestial "
"pole as their boundaries to facilitate the positioning of celestial bodies.\n"
"\n"
"If a celestial body is east of the determinative star of a Mansion, and its "
"right ascension does not exceed the determinative star of the next Mansion, "
"the difference in right ascension between this celestial body and the "
"determinative star, is know as mansion distance degrees (Chinese: 入宿度; "
"pinyin: rùxiùdù).\n"
"\n"
"Coupled with the polar distance degrees(Chinese: 去极度; pinyin: qùjídù), "
"which is the angular distance between the star and the north celestial pole, "
"we can determine the position of a star on the celestial sphere. Mansion "
"distance degrees and polar distance degrees together constitute the two "
"components of the ancient Chinese equatorial coordinate system.\n"
"\n"
"The Twenty-Eight Mansions are grouped into Four Symbols (Chinese: 四象; "
"pinyin: sìxiàng), each associated with a compass direction and containing "
"seven Mansions, corresponds to Seven Luminaries. The correspondence between "
"the Twenty-Eight Mansions and the Four Symbols is based on the sky at dusk "
"on the vernal equinox in a certain period of ancient times. At this time, "
"the Vermilion Bird is in the south, the Azure Dragon is in the east, the "
"Black Tortoise is in the north, and the White Tiger is in the west.\n"

"### The Southern Sky\n"
"\n"
"The sky around the south celestial pole was unknown to ancient Chinese. "
"Therefore, it was not included in the Three Enclosures and Twenty-Eight "
"Mansions system. However, in the late Ming Dynasty, Xu Guangqi (Chinese: 徐光"
"启; pinyin: Xú Guāngqǐ) introduced another 23 Xingguans based on the "
"European star charts. These Xingguans were since incorporated into the "
"traditional Chinese star maps. These Xingguans are actually variations of "
"Western constellations, and they are mostly named after animals.\n"

"This Sky Culture is Based on the information inside *Chinese and Western "
"Contrast Star Chart and Catalogue 1950.0 (Star Catalogue)* (Chinese: 中西对照"
"恒星图表1950.0(星表分册)) and *Complete Studies of Astronomical* (Chinese: 仪"
"象考成).\n"
"\n"
"Thanks to Liu Chunbin for the collation of the *Chinese and Western Contrast "
"Star Chart and Catalogue 1950.0 (Star Catalogue)*. He produced *Chinese Star "
"Catalogue for Stellarium* (Chinese: Stellarium 中国星官体系下中文星名扩展包) "
"which is a very important reference.\n"
"\n"
"Some stars have been added according to *The History of Stellar Observation "
"in China* (Chinese: 中国恒星观测史).\n"
"\n"
"For the translation of constellations, we use the *English-Chinese Glossary "
"of Chinese Star Regions, Asterisms and Star Names* (Chinese: 中国星区、星官及"
"星名英译表) by Hong Kong Space Museum. Only a small portion of the "
"translation is changed, for example, when the translations of the two "
"different Xingguans are the same.\n"
"\n"
"There are seven stars with Chinese star names without corresponding HIP "
"numbers, so they cannot be displayed in Stellarium. They are Sea and "
"Mountain II (η Car), Five Chariots Added XVIII (12 Aur), Recommending "
"Virtuous Man Added VI (39 Vir) , Great Horn Added II (CN Boo), Hairy Head "
"Added X (24 Tau), Heart Added VII (18 Oph), South River Added XI (GC "
"10303).\n"
"\n"
"The cultural connotations of the name cannot be explained perfectly, because "
"thousands of years passed, the connotations behind some names are "
"controversial. these are only possible translations. Chinese characters are "
"ideographic characters, which leads to some completely different names "
"having the same pronunciation. Therefore, the pinyin transliteration is "
"provided only to make star names readable."

"### Sun, Moon and Planets\n"
"\n"
"西方國家以神話人物命名行星。中國自漢代起將五顆行星的名稱與五行的概念相匹配。"
"因此，辰星叫水星，太白叫金星，熒惑叫火星，歲星叫木星，鎮星叫土星。\n"

"\n"
"### Xingguans\n"
"\n"
"中國傳統天文學有一個將天球划分爲星群或星座的系統，稱爲「星官」。現代星座指的"
"是天球的特定區域。星官只是指恆星的排列方式，星官之間沒有具體的界限。\n"
"\n"
"The name and layout of the Xingguans are very social, the kingdom, the "
"mountains, the goods, the industry all move to the sky, according to the "
"Earth's way in the sky to copy a world.\n"
"\n"
"星官通常比希臘傳統的星座要小。一個星官多的是幾十顆星，少的只有一顆。中古中國"
"星圖一般有星官共283個，共1464顆星。星官分爲 31 個區域，沿黃道的二十八宿和北天"
"的三垣。由於歲差的影響，南方地平線附近的六個星官越來越南。明清時期天文學家已"
"不易觀測到，故《儀象考成》不再記載。\n"
"\n"
"明末（17世紀）以前，南天極周圍沒有星官。近南極星區（南天）是明末根據歐洲星圖"
"添加的第 32 個區域，包括 23 個新增星官。近南極星區現在也被視爲中國傳統系統的"
"一部分。\n"
"\n"
"明末以來，西方傳教士進入欽天監。他們沿用了星官的名字，只是改變了一些星官對應"
"的星，幾乎每一個星官都加了一些星，叫做「增星」。原有的星稱爲「正星」。若一個"
"星官由兩顆或更多顆星組成，每顆星都有一個編號。《儀象考成續編》中的星名是星官"
"加數字。但也有幾個星官，每顆星都有專門的名字。\n"

"Xingguans and 3240 stars in total.\n"

"### 二十八宿\n"
"\n"
"二十八宿，是中國古代在黃道和赤道附近劃分的天區，將黃道按赤經分為28個區域。 每"
"個區域稱爲一宿，月亮每天所在的天區就被古人看成月亮當天歇息的住所。\n"
"\n"
"各宿在黃道附近各有一座同名星官，即主星官。 附近區域的星官屬於宿。\n"
"\n"
"每個星官都有一顆主星，稱爲距星。 在中國古代，二十八宿距星是確定赤道坐標系經度"
"的基準。 相鄰兩宿西側距星的赤經差爲宿度。 中國傳統的赤道坐標系將赤道分爲"
"365.25度，太陽運行一天轉一度，也是28宿的宿度數之和。\n"
"\n"
"由於歲差的影響，各個宿的宿度一直在慢慢變化，歷史上一些距星也發生了變化。\n"
"\n"
"在中國傳統星圖上，有28條線以北天極爲界穿過二十八宿的距星，以方便天體定位。\n"
"\n"
"若某天體在本宿距星以東，且其赤經不超過下一宿距星的赤經，則該天體與距星的赤經"
"差，稱爲入宿度。\n"
"\n"
"去極度，即恆星與北天極之間的角距，我們可以確定恆星在天球上的位置。 入宿度和去"
"極度共同構成中國古代赤道坐標系的兩個分量。\n"
"\n"
"二十八宿分爲四象，每象都與一個羅盤方向相關聯，並包含七宿，對應於七曜。 二十八"
"宿與四象的對應關係，是以古代某一時期春分黃昏時分的天空爲依據的。 此時朱雀在"
"南，青龍在東，玄武在北，白虎在西。\n"

"南天極周圍的天空對古代中國人來說是未知的。 故未列入三垣二十八宿體系。 然而，"
"在明末，徐光啓根據歐洲星圖引入了另外 23 個星官。 這些星官從此被納入了中國傳統"
"的星圖。 這些星官實際上是西方星座的變種，多以動物命名。\n"

"### Medieval Xingguans\n"
"\n"
"From the Three Kingdoms Period to the Ming Dynasty, covering the whole of "
"the Middle Ages, China's star map is similar.\n"
"\n"
"The Xingguans originated in ancient times. Wuxian (巫咸) of Shang "
"Dynasty(16th century BC-1046 BC), Gan De (甘德) and Shi Shen (石申) of The "
"Warring States Period (475–221 BC), created their own Xingguan system "
"respectively. During the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD), Chen Zhuo (陈"
"卓) summarized the Xingguans system of Gan De, Shi Shen and Wuxian, "
"including 283 Xingguans and 1464 stars. Since then, Xingguan system has been "
"basically defined, and after a thousand years, there has not been much "
"change. Since the 17th century, Western astronomy has had an impact on "
"Chinese astronomy, and the shape and number of Xingguans have changed "
"significantly. Only about half of the constellations maintained the medieval "
"style.\n"
"\n"
"Determinative star is an important concept. In the Middle Ages, Chinese "
"astronomers did not name all stars, and each Xingguans was chosen as a major "
"star called determinative star. In ancient China, astronomical measurements "
"measured its coordinate position, and other stars in the Xingguan were "
"rarely mentioned. However, some important constellations will be selected "
"more stars for observation and recording. In ancient China, astronomers used "
"mansion distance degrees (determinative star distance) and polar distance "
"degrees to record the position of stars. **In ancient China, the "
"determinative stars of Twenty-eight Lunar Mansions was the benchmark for "
"determining the longitude of the equatorial coordinate system**.\n"
"\n"
"The *Song of the Sky Pacers* (步天歌) is an early Chinese star catalogue in "
"the form of poem in heptasyllabic verse, enumerating the names of stars.\n"
"\n"
"Below is *Xinyixiangfayao Star Map* from Su Song(苏颂, 1020-1101 AD).\n"
"\n"
"![](illustrations/xyxfy.png)\n"
"\n"
"*Xinyixiangfayao Star Map(1088 AD)*\n"
"\n"
"### Restore Sky Map\n"
"\n"
"The sky map of the Song dynasty is typical of the Chinese medieval sky map. "
"In 1052 AD, the Song Dynasty official conducted accurate stellar "
"measurements, leaving a lot of data.\n"
"\n"
"Pan Nai(潘鼐) collated these astronomical observations data and based on the "
"*Xinyixiangfayao Star Map*, he restored most of the Song Dynasty's Xingguan "
"in his masterpiece *The History of Stellar Observation in China*, which is "
"the most important reference book. Qi Rui (齐锐) and Wan Haoyi (万昊宜) also "
"restored the Xingguans of the Song Dynasty in the book *Roving China "
"Heavens*, which is also an important reference book.\n"
"\n"
"Due to the limitation of observation conditions in Song Dynasty, combined "
"with instruments, circulated errors and other reasons, different scholars "
"restored the sky map is somewhat different.\n"
"\n"
"Based on these books, Stellarium can almost truly present the Chinese "
"medieval sky map of Huangyou four years (1052 AD).\n"

"### Planets\n"

"Taiyang (太阳), Sun. The name comes from yin and yang, meaning a lot of "

"Taiyin (太阴), Moon. The name comes from yin and yang, meaning a lot of "

"\n"
"Chen Star (辰星), Mercury. Chen is an angle unit, which refers to about 30 "
"degrees. Mercury is always within 30 degrees of the sun.\n"

"Taibai (太白), Venus. Taibai means big and white.\n"
"\n"
"Yinghuo (荧惑), Mars. The colors of Mars are like fire, and movement is "
"confusing.\n"
"\n"
"Sui Star (岁星), Jupiter. It means the old star. Jupiter travels around the "
"celestial sphere for a week every 12 years. The ancients took Jupiter's "
"position as the standard of the chronology.\n"
"\n"
"Zhen Star (填星), Saturn. Zhen, means passing Lunar Mansions. Saturn travels "
"around the celestial sphere about every 28 years. Saturn will pass through a "
"Lunar Mansion every year."

"### 中古星官\n"
"\n"
"從三國時期到明朝，中國的星圖大同小異。\n"
"\n"
"星官起源於上古時代。商代（公元前16世紀-公元前1046年）的巫咸、戰國時期（公元前"
"475-221年）的甘德和石申分別創建了自己的星官制度。三國時期（公元220-280年），"
"陳卓總結了甘德、石申、巫咸的星官體系，包括星官283個，星1464顆。此後，星官制度"
"基本確定，歷經一千年，也沒有太大的變化。17世紀以來，西方天文學對中國天文學產"
"生了影響，星官的形狀和數量都發生了明顯的變化。只有大約一半的星官保持著中古的"
"形態。\n"
"\n"
"距星是一個重要的概念。中古時期，中國的天文學家並沒有給所有的恆星命名，每一個"
"星官都選擇了一顆主星，稱為距星。在中國古代，天文測量測量的是距星的坐標位置，"
"很少提及星官中的其他星體。但是，一些重要的星官會選擇更多的恆星進行觀測和記"
"錄。在中國古代，天文學家用入宿度（距星距）和去極度來記錄恆星的位置。**在中國"
"古代，二十八宿的距星是確定赤道坐標系經度的基準。**\n"
"\n"
"《步天歌》是中國早期的星表，以七言詩的形式列舉星名。\n"
"\n"
"以下是蘇頌（公元1020-1101年）的《新儀象法要星圖》。\n"
"\n"
"![](illustrations/xyxfy.png)\n"
"\n"
"*新儀象法要星圖（公元1088年）*\n"
"\n"
"### 復原星圖\n"
"\n"
"皇祐星表是中國中古時期星圖的典型代表。公元1052年，宋朝官方進行了精確的星體測"
"量，留下了大量數據。\n"
"\n"
"潘鼐整理了這些天文觀測資料，並以《新儀象法要星圖》爲依據，在他的巨著《中國恆"
"星觀測史》中還原了宋代星官的大部分，是最重要的參考書。齊銳和萬昊宜在《漫步中"
"國星空》一書中也修復了宋代的星官，這也是一本重要的參考書。\n"
"\n"
"Due to the limitation of observation conditions in Song Dynasty, combined "
"with instruments, circulated errors and other reasons, different scholars "
"restored the sky map is somewhat different.\n"
"\n"
"基於這些書籍，Stellarium 幾乎可以真實地呈現出皇祐四年（公元 1052 年）的中國星"
"圖。\n"
"\n"
"### 行星\n"
"\n"
"太陽，日。至陽之物爲太陽。\n"
"\n"
"太陰，月。至陰之物爲太陰。\n"
"\n"
"辰星，水星。辰是一個角度單位，指的是30度左右。水星總是在太陽的 30 度以內。\n"
"\n"
"太白，金星。夜空中最亮的星。\n"
"\n"
"熒惑，火星。星色熒熒如火，行動令人迷惑。\n"
"\n"
"歲星，木星。木星每 12 年運行一周天。古人將黃道附近一周天分為十二星次，以木星"
"每行一星次作爲紀年的標準。\n"
"\n"
"鎮星，即土星，常寫作填星。土星約每 29 年繞天球運行一次，每年都會坐鎮一個不同"
"的星宿，因而得名。"

"<p>The sculptured Dendera zodiac (or Denderah zodiac) is a widely known "

"### Planets\n"
"\n"
"In this sky culture, some Egyptian names are attached to the planets. "
"Honestly, each planet had many names, sometimes depending on the context (e."
"g. Venus as morning star and evening star). We cannot include all names in "
"the Stellarium name but they are stored in other database. On the Dendera "
"ceiling, the planets are represented at fixed positions and as deities.\n"
"\n"
"The planets are depicted as deities in their \"standard position\". As "
"planets move, they can only be presented in the sky by defining fixed "
"positions where the figurative representation is found in every celestial "
"map, every star list and catalogue.\n"

"### Zodiac\n"
"\n"
"The zodiac came to Greece from Babylonian sources. It is unknown whether or "
"not the Egyptians had similar figures: The origin of the zodiac is the path "
"of the Moon and was, thus, important for the Egyptian calendar, too. "
"However, the zodiac depicted in Dendera is definitely the Greek (partially "
"misunderstood) interpretation of the Babylonian one.\n"
"\n"
"The Zodiac is the Babylonian one with the semi-exception of Pisces: Pisces "
"are depicted as two fish which is never found in Babylon and only an "
"analogon is known in Late Babylonian epoch in the city of Uruk. In Uruk, the "
"constellation  was changed to the constellation of the Swallow-Fish "
"connecting a swallow and a fish. In contrast, in Babylon it has always been "
"\"The Tails of the Giant Swallow\" (Steele 2018).\n"
"\n"
" The other constellations of the zodiac are the Babylonian versions, "
"partially egyptized. Virgo is depicted as the Babylonian Goddess Shala with "
"the Ear of Grain, Capricornus as a Goat-Fish accompanying the Babylonian god "
"of witchcraft (Aquarius), Sagittarius as the Babylonian god Pabilsang. "
"Scorpion, Aries and Cancer leave rather no room for interpretation. Leo is "
"depicted as a usual lion but carries the Egyptian queen Berenice (whose name "
"was given to the constellation Coma Berenices) at his tail. Gemini are not "
"depicted as Twins but as a couple, the Bull is not halved.\n"
"\n"
"### Outside the Zodiac\n"
"\n"
"The rest of the sky  also shows a mixture of several cultures: The hippo "
"goddess who guards the Ox Thigh is a clearly Egyptian constellation. "
"Interestingly, there is a desert fox and a sheep next to the ox thigh which "
"refers to same positions in the sky as the Babylonian constellations of the "
"Fox and the Ewe.\n"
"\n"
"In contrast to these native Egyptian constellations, there are also native "
"Sumerian ones that are depicted in an Egyptized way: This is marked in the "
"\"Translation\" of the Stellarium labels.\n"
"\n"
"Interestingly, this depiction explains several Greek names of single stars: "
"e.g. at the position of Capella, there is a whitish Goat in the Dendera "
"ceiling, and at the position of the star Canopus whose name is already "
"attested in Ptolemy's Almagest, there is a Horus-falcon on a canopy jar. It "
"suggests that these were originally Egyptian images that have been "
"transformed to star names in a later epoch in order to commemorate the "
"outdated constellations.\n"

msgid ""
"<p>This ancient Greek sky culture is compiled in a book that is today known "
"by its Arabic title \"Almagest\".\n"
"This book was written in Roman time (under the reign of Roman emperor "
"Hadrian) at Alexandria (Africa) in\n"
"Greek language, with dates given in Egyptian month names and years counted "
"after a Babylonian king,\n"
"so it is clearly a multi-cultural compendium of knowledge. It is a "
"compilation of\n"
"astronomical knowledge of former astronomers including results from\n"
"observations and mathematical astronomy. Pieced together by Claudius\n"
"Ptolemy, using older, as well as his own, observations, it was written\n"
"in Greek, published in the Second Century and remained the main\n"
"astronomical work for the following 1500 years. It was originally written\n"
"with the title <i>Mathematike Syntaxis</i>, in Ancient Greek.\n"
"The name <i>Almagest</i>, meaning &ldquo;The Largest [Book]&rdquo;, was\n"
"developed from Arabian translations. To create this sky culture we used\n"
"the English translation by Toomer (1984), reworked it in some details\n"
"(e.g. using more literal translations from Greek instead of Latin terms "
"that\n"
"are common today) and we made use of computer readable tables prepared\n"
"by Ernie Wright.</p>"
msgstr ""

#. Greek (Almagest) sky culture description section in markdown format
msgid ""
"The Almagest consists of 13 sections, called books. In the seventh\n"
"and eighth book, Ptolemy listed a total of 1022 stars in 48 constellations\n"
"(among which are about 5 star-like objects like globular star clusters).\n"
"It is a table of coordinates of the stars with a description of their\n"
"position in the constellation (such as \"star at the elbow of X, longitude,\n"
"latitude, magnitude\"). With regard to precession, Ptolemy used ecliptic\n"
"coordinates. As one of the first of his time, Ptolemy included the\n"
"magnitude, a quantitative scale of stellar brightness, probably adopted\n"
"from Hipparchus (which is not certain because Hipparchus&rsquo; catalog\n"
"is not preserved). The scale starts with the brightest star with the\n"
"magnitude of 1, going down to magnitude of 6, for the faintest stars\n"
"visible.\n"
"\n"
"<p>For the computation of planet positions Ptolemy used a geocentric model\n"
"(which is allowed because the observer always stands on Earth) and, thus,\n"
"contributed to the scientific belief that the heliocentric model by\n"
"Aristarch was not needed. However, for the star catalogue of the\n"
"<i>Almagest</i> this does not matter at all because a star catalogue\n"
"always represents a sort of inventory of the fixed dots in the sky and\n"
"Ptolemy's proclaimed aim of the catalogue is to provide a list for making\n"
"a celestial globe (see Alm., VIII, 3). Being aware of precession he wants\n"
"to ease the business of future globemakers by using ecliptical coordinates:\n"
"Precession as known to Ptolemy shifts all stars parallel to the ecliptic,\n"
"therefore updates to the epoch of the respective globemaker could be\n"
"applied by a simple subtraction of the value for ecliptic longitude.</p>\n"
"\n"
"### How this sky culture was made\n"
"\n"
"### Star names\n"
"\n"
"Out of more than 1,000 stars, Ptolemy mentions a proper name for only 15.\n"
"The rest are identified by fairly long descriptions such as \"The star on\n"
"the end of the tail\" for the Polaris. In order to avoid displaying such "
"long\n"
"strings across the screen in Stellarium, we invented short labels for all\n"
"Almagest stars based on the constellation and the order in which they appear "
"in\n"
"the catalogue.  For example, Polaris is given a designation \"UMi 1\" "
"because\n"
"it is the first star in the constellation of Small Bear (UMi).  See the "
"table\n"
"below for the correspondence between Ptolemy constellations and IAU "
"abbreviations.\n"
"In addition, where Ptolemy describes a star as lying outside of the figure,\n"
"we use lowercase letters in the corresponding label. To see the long "
"description\n"
"for a given star, users should enable \"Use additional names of stars\" in "
"the\n"
"\"View [F4]/Sky\" settings and click on the star. The long description will "
"then\n"
"be displayed at the top of the screen.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellation lines\n"
"\n"
"The process can be described as sketched here with the example of\n"
"Corvus:\n"
"\n"
"In the constellation of Corvus (Raven), &alpha; Crv is the star in\n"
"the &quot;head of the raven&quot;. It is connected with the &quot;star\n"
"in the neck&quot;, &epsilon; Crv.  This one is connected with &quot;the\n"
"star in the breast&quot; &zeta; Crv.  From there two lines go to the\n"
"tips of the wings. &gamma; Crv is the star in the advanced wing and\n"
"&delta; Crv the star in the rear wing. From the star in the breast\n"
"another line goes to the &quot;foot of the raven&quot;, the star &beta;\n"
"Crv.\n"
"\n"
"<p><img width=\"800\" src=\"illustrations/corvus_s.png\" /></p>\n"
"<p>After identifying the stars based on their coordinates and names, we\n"
"reconnected the stars according to the descriptions in the table\n"
"presented in the <i>Almagest</i>.</p>\n"
"<p>The names of stars and names of deep sky objects rely on the Almagest\n"
"only, e.g. Ptolemy uses the name &quot;&lambda;&alpha;&mu;&pi;&alpha;&delta;"
"&#943;&alpha;&sigmaf;\n"
"(The Torch-like)&quot; for Aldebaran in his other work, the\n"
"<i>Tetrabiblos</i>, but this is not implemented in this sky culture because\n"
"it doesn't show up in the Almagest.</p>\n"

"Dante Alighieri mentions several stars and a few constellations: "
"predominantly, the zodiacal constellation of Gemini. The Twins occurs in his "
"texts (in the comedia as well as his poems). As Dante is not an astronomer "
"but a person with broad knowledge, his view of the constellations is highly "
"like not based upon observations of the sky but on manuscripts that he read. "
"Therefore, we chose to take the zodiacal constellation images from Michael "
"Scotus whose manuscript was very popular in Dante's time.\n"
"\n"
"Dante Alighieri was a citizen of Florence, Italy, who was later banned and "
"lived at several places in Northern Italy. The comedia was written around "
"1300 but finished only short before his death in 1321. It is commonly "
"assumed that the story plays in around the Christian festival of Easter in "
"1300 CE."

"### How this Sky Culture was made\n"
"\n"
"The Dante experts of the German Dante Society selected some text passages "
"with astronomical references in order to present them at Planetarium Jena in "
"the dome. Professor Blume's suggestion that Dante likely had Michael "
"Scotus's drawings of the constellations in mind was accepted. Therefore, we "
"copied these drawings and mapped them onto the stars. The \"16\" bright "
"stars that are mentioned by Dante are usually interpreted by romanists as "
"the stars of first magnitude in the Almagest. Therefore, these stars where "
"highlighted with the \"star\"-symbol in Stellarium. Additionally, we painted "
"a chariot (wagon) and a horn.\n"
"\n"
"Dante calls the seven bright stars of Ursa Major \"The Chariot\", the "
"constellation of Ursa Minor \"The Horn\", and possibly refers to Corona "
"Borealis when he mentions a ring of stars. The latter interpretation is in "
"our view unlikely but is discussed among researchers which is why we marked "
"the stars of Corona Borealis as it is described in the Almagest."

"This ancient Greek celestial culture is based on the marble globe of the "
"Atlas statue in the Villa Farnese (Naples). The statue dates to the 2nd "
"century AD, i.e. Roman times. However, it is a copy of an older Greek model, "
"which itself has not survived."

"The marble globe only depicts figures and no stars. The globe has a diameter "
"of about 65 cm. The figures were not aligned according to exact point "
"coordinates, but in a grid: the ecliptic, the celestial equator, the tropics "
"and the polar circles provide orientation in terms of position in \"latitude "
"circles\" on the celestial sphere, while the coluric circles provide a four-"
"way division in \"longitude circles\". Ancient globe makers used this very "
"coarse-meshed grid to adjust the figure drawings.\n"
"\n"
"The images of the globe therefore clearly show that the stonemason who "
"created the globe had the popular doctrinal poem by Aratos of Soloi (~300 "
"BCE) in mind. There is no reason for the claim - often inflated by popular "
"science - that this marble globe was carved according to Hipparchus' star "
"catalogue. This thesis has been repeatedly raised over the past ~200 years, "
"but regularly dismissed: Both mathematical arguments and artistic "
"representations speak against it.\n"

"\n"
"Only the torso of the man was preserved and with broken elbows: everything "
"below the hip has been supplemented in a modern way. In this form, the "
"sculpture is 2.10 m high. The sculpture of the globe with constellations, "
"which is important for us, is original, but has a large hole at the north "
"pole - presumably it was anchored there to other parts of the architecture. "
"Therefore, the circumpolar constellations of the two she-bears and parts of "
"the dragon are missing.\n"
"\n"
"### How was this Sky Culture made?\n"
"\n"
"The illustrations of the individual figures were copied from the marble "
"globe as pencil sketches. Stellarium works with point coordinates of the "
"modern HIPPARCOS catalogue (produced by an astrometry satellite), so that "
"the historical drawings have to be locked at three points (stars) each. "
"Since this sometimes leads to distortions in historical figures (the marble "
"globe is not a perfect sphere, the figures were not fitted according to "
"point coordinates), this was done here \"by eye\" - just as by the "
"historical stonemason.\n"
"\n"
"The names of the constellations and individual stars were taken from the "
"Almagest star catalogue, which also dates from the 2nd century (i.e. the "
"reign of the Roman Emperor Hadrian) and - as was customary at the time - was "
"written in Greek as scientific literature.\n"
"\n"
"The marble globe was a decorative element in a building, probably a "
"particularly elaborate capital. It has no scientific accuracy. Therefore, "
"some drawings in relief deviate from the exact star positions of the star "
"catalogue: e.g. the Twins (Gemini) are moved slightly to the side to show "
"the figure completely, although the lower part of this celestial region "
"would be covered by the hand of the Atlas statue. There are similar "
"distortions in the Scorpion.\n"

"columns 2 and 3, and in column 4 the image on the globe.\n"

"This is a manuscript from the Carolingian period, two copies of which are "
"known so far. One was found in Metz (France), the other in Leiden "
"(Netherlands). It dates to the reign of the Carolingian king Louis the Pious "
"(778-840), who may have been the patron himself (or his wife).\n"
"\n"
"The manuscript was probably created around 816 to 825 in Aachen or Metz "
"(Lorraine) and was made with such expensive material that a royal patron is "
"suspected. It comprises 99 parchment leaves, each of which measures 22.5 by "
"20.0 cm (i.e. approximately square with the width of DIN A4). In addition to "
"graphic representations of planetary orbits and other didactic "
"visualisations, this manuscript also contains 35 full-page miniatures "
"depicting the ancient figures behind the constellations."

"The figures are drawn from a non-preserved Roman model, but not from a "
"globe, so that there is no fit to the stars. The stars themselves are only "
"symbolically distributed on the figures, i.e. the number of stars per figure "
"is marked in the manuscript in the form of applied gold leaves. The gold "
"leaves, however, are not located at the true places of the stars in view of "
"the figure in the sky, but are only indicated summarily. Elly Decker's essay "
"discusses her proposed identifications in detail.\n"

"### How this Sky Culture was made\n"
"\n"
"The illustrations of the individual figures were taken directly from the "
"manuscript (provided by Prof. D. Blume, Jena, for planetarium applications). "
"Stellarium works with point coordinates for stars in the catalogue of the "
"astrometry satellite HIPPARCOS, so that the historical drawings have to be "
"locked at three points each. Some of the flat book illustrations had to be "
"distorted slightly on the planetarium dome to fit the stars. Except for the "
"illustration of Scorpius and Ophiuchus, an approximate adjustment was "
"possible.\n"
"\n"
" In a planetarium dome, i.e. against a dark background, the dark blue and "
"black parts of the manuscript are not recognisable. That is why these parts "
"(e.g. the crab as a figure, the horns of the ibex, the goats of the "
"carter...) were colour-inverted. The female bears, which are supposed to be "
"dark, have only been shifted slightly into the red. How the image looks in "
"the original (with its lapis lazuli blue background and the original dark "
"colours) is shown in the table below.\n"
"\n"
"There are some constellations in the Leiden Aratea, in particular Cen + Lup, "
"Vir, Lib are leaving a huge gap in the sky.\n"
"Both, Virgo and Centaur are probably not painted because the painter thought "
"it were variants of the images of Sgr (Cen) and And (Vir).\n"
"The artist of the Leiden Aratea never mapped the images onto the stars.\n"
"In order to make these depictions understandable for us, I mapped them in "
"Stellarium and added the names and stickfigures of the constellations and "
"the names of individual stars from the Almagest.\n"
"The Almagest is a book of mathematical astronomy of the 2nd century (i.e. "
"the reign of the Roman Emperor Hadrian) while Aratos's poem describes a much "
"earlier (~300 BCE) Greek sky culture.\n"
"Both, the Almagest and the poem, are written in Greek originally but the "
"Leiden Aratea presumably refers to a Latin translation of Aratus' poem and "
"Roman artwork.\n"
"\n"
"The following table lists the original names of the constellations in "
"columns 2 and 3. constellations, in column 4 the illustration in the "
"manuscript.\n"

"### History\n"
"\n"
"The knowledge of Hawaiian star navigation has been passed down orally for "
"many generations.   Much of the knowledge regarding stars and navigation "
"were lost until the Hawaiian Renaissance in the early 1970s. Polynesian "
"Voyage Society (PVS), founded in 1973, created Hokule’a in 1975. Hokule’a is "
"a traditional Hawaiian voyaging canoe with the mission to revive the art of "
"way finding. A man from Satawal, Micronesia named Mau Piailug was a master "
"navigator/wayfinder. The knowledge of wayfinding and using the sky to "
"navigate was passed down to Mau from his ancestors. Nainoa Thompson, current "
"President of PVS, asked Mau to teach his knowledge of navigation to him with "
"the intention of reviving the knowledge that was once lost to the Hawaiians. "
"With the knowledge learned from Mau, the Hawaiian star compass and star "
"lines were created.\n"
"\n"
"### Star Lines\n"
"\n"
"Each star line is a group of main stars that will be remembered by the "
"navigators. The stars connect making constellations. Navigators remember the "
"rising/setting houses of these stars, the stars that connect in each line, "
"and the lines that point directly to North and South. The star lines’ "
"position in the night sky slowly change over time, each starline being more "
"prevalent at night according to the season. The star lines with their "
"according season are as follows:\n"

"\n"
"### <notr>Ke Ka o Makali’i</notr>\n"
"\n"
"The direct translation means the “Bailer of *Makali’i*”. The lines are "
"shaped as a canoe bailer which scoops *Ka Hei-Hei o Na Keiki* (Orion) and "
"*Makali’i* (Pleiades) up into the night sky. In voyaging a bailer is used to "
"scoop up water out of the hulls.\n"
"\n"
"The main stars of *Ke Ka o Makali’i* from North to South are *Hokulei* "
"(Capella), *Nanamua* (Castor), *Nanahope* (Pollux), *Puana* (Procyon), and "
"*‘A’a* (Sirius). These stars connect together to create the bailer in the "
"sky. Mintaka in Orion is an important star in this line because it rises/"
"sets directly east or west giving the navigator an easy pointer star for "
"direction. Mirzim (next to *‘A’a* (Sirius)) and *Ke Ali’i Kona i Ka Lewa* "
"(Canopus) connect together to create a southern pointer. *‘Ekekeuehuehu* "
"(&theta; Aur, Mahasim) and *‘Ekekeu’ena’ena* (&beta; Aur, Menkalinan) "
"connect to create a northern pointer. Different north/south pointers are "
"found in the star lines and used heavily by navigators.\n"
"\n"
"### <notr>Ka Iwikuamo’o</notr>\n"
"\n"
"*Ka Iwikuamo’o* translates to the backbone (directly: Bone back-lizard). "
"This star line is depicted as the backbone of a lizard or *mo’o* in this sky "
"culture. It can also be representing a genealogical backbone, each star "
"representing a generation.\n"
"\n"
"The star line itself starts with *Hokupa’a* (North Star), the ultimate "
"northern pointer due to the star never moving in the sky, always above "
"north. *Hokupa’a* connects down to *Na Hiku* (Big Dipper). *Na Hiku* "
"translates to “The Seven” as there is seven stars in the Big Dipper. "
"*Hokule’a* (Arcturus) and *Hikianalia* (Spica) are the two stars in the "
"middle of the star line. The two PVS canoes are named after these two stars. "
"*Hokule’a* is the “zenith” star of Hawai’i, meaning it will be directly "
"overhead when you are at the latitude of the Hawaiian Islands. *Hokule’a* is "
"very important to navigators on finding their way back to Hawai’i. The "
"meaning of *Hokule’a* is “the star of gladness” because it is the star used "
"to find home bringing joy. Next to *Hikianalia* is *Me’e*, a combination of "
"four stars that create a box. *Me’e* connects down to *Hanaiakamalama* "
"(Southern Cross) which is the southern pointer for *Ka Iwikuamo’o*.\n"
"\n"
"### <notr>Manaiakalani</notr>\n"
"\n"
"*Manaiakalani* translates to “The Chief's Fishline”. This refers to the "
"legend of the demi god Maui and his fish hook. Maui is credited for pulling "
"up the islands with his magical fish hook.\n"
"\n"
"This star line consists of two constellations. The Navigator’s Triangle on "
"the north and Maui’s fish hook on the south. The Navigator’s Triangle is "
"made of three stars *Hawaiki* (Deneb), *Keoe* (Vega), and *Humu* (Altair). "
"(It is the same figure as the Summer Triangle for modern amateur "
"astronomers.) These stars also represent the Polynesian triangle: Hawai’i "
"(*Hawaiki*), Rapanui (*Keoe*), and Aotearoa (*Humu*). These three islands "
"are pulled by the fish hook of Maui (Scorpius).\n"
"\n"
"The northern pointer is found in the Navigator’s Triangle when you connect "
"*Hawaiki* (Deneb) and *Momonapikowalu* (&gamma; Cyg, Sadr). Southern "
"pointers are in the fish hook when you connect *Mili’opu* (&delta; Sco, "
"Dschubba) and *Kahe* (&pi; Sco, Nur), the stars on the top of the hook.\n"
"\n"
"### <notr>Ka Lupe o Kawelo</notr>\n"
"\n"
"*Ka Lupe o Kawelo* translates to “The Kite of Kawelo”. Kawelo was a great "
"chief of Kaua’i and O’ahu and this star line represents the kite which was "
"lost as a child.\n"
"\n"
"The star line starts with *‘Iwakeli’i*, meaning Chief Frigate Bird (*Fregata "
"Minor*). The shape of this constellation (which is Cassiopeia's W in the "
"West) resembles the *‘iwa* bird that is known for leading voyagers to land. "
"The center of the star line is the Kite of Kawelo (equal to the Great Square "
"of Pegasus). The four stars that make the kite are named after Kawelo’s "
"greatest ancestors: *Manokalanipo* (&delta; Peg, Alpheratz), *Kakuhihewa* "
"(&beta; Peg, Scheat), *Pi’ilani* (&gamma; Peg, Algenib), and *Keawe* "
"(&alpha; Peg, Markab). All four were famous chiefs of their time. The star "
"line then connects south to two stars *Pi’ikea* (&beta; Cet, Deneb Kaitos) "

"### <notr>Rāśi (राशिः)</notr>\n"
"\n"
"The sidereal zodiac is an imaginary belt of 360 degrees (like the tropical "
"zodiac), divided into 12 equal parts. Each twelfth part (of 30 degrees) is "
"called a sign or rashi. Their names are shown in (brackets).\n"
"\n"
"In stellarium, we show Rāśi constellations attached to the corresponding "
"asterisms, and not as divisions of the ecliptic offset away from their "
"original locations to account for precession.\n"
"\n"
"In traditional astronomy there are two systems of measuring time - Lunar "
"Calender & Solar calender. In both cases one year is divided into 12 months "
"or \"māsā\". Name of the solar months originated from these constellation' "
"names.\n"
"\n"
"### <notr>Nakṣatra (नक्षत्रम्)</notr>\n"
"\n"
"In Hindu tradition the ecliptic is divided into 27 parts of approximately "
"13°20', which correspond with 27 asterisms known as the nakṣatra-s (full "
"list, with western equivalents here: https://goo.gl/2PVi28 ). In the "
"earliest extant layers of the tradition this number is 28. This division is "
"critical for several purposes including timing rituals and determining the "
"birth lunar mansions. Since these asterisms define an area in the sky, they "
"are also technically constellations.\n"
"\n"
"sUrya-siddhAnta and vedAnga-jyotiSha specify start coordinates for the "
"13°20' divisions using some stars (Please see penultimate paragraph in [this "
"page](https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfCalendarPanchangaCommittee/History-"
"of-Calendar-Panchanga-Committee#page/n42/mode/1up))\n"
"\n"
"The earliest complete nakṣatra lists are found in the Taittirīya-śruti and "
"the Atharvaveda where they are recited as part of the nakṣatreṣṭi ritual "
"which places the deities of pantheon in these celestial compartments. Some "
"scholars opine that the tradition shows that by the early medieval period, "
"the nakṣatra identification had changed to a small degree from the Vedic "
"period.\n"
"\n"
"There are multiple rich mythologies and symbolisms associated with the same "
"constellations and stars (Example: [Raj Vedam on Rohini](https://www.youtube."
"com/watch?v=Jq__DXtfeXw)) - it wouldn't do to rely on one to the exclusion "
"of others during translation or truncated description. Hence we stick to "
"etymological translations; and rather than including long mythological "
"accounts here, just suggest that interested readers delve into them "
"separately. (See references below.)\n"
"\n"
"Name of the lunar months originated from those 12 divisions' names in which "
"full moon or \"Purnimā\" occurs. Unlike a solar day which defined by a "
"sunrise to next sunrise, a lunar day or moon's position in a nakshatra "
"doesn't depends on sun rising or moon rising. Thus a lunar day may start in "
"any time of a solar day. Like other ancient human cultures, vedic people "
"innovated a number of systems of which intercalary lunar months became most "
"used, that is adding another month every 32.5 months on average or 4 months "
"in every 11 years to correct the mismatch between lunar and solar year.\n"
"\n"
"A few of the yogatārā-s or prominent asterisms in the nakṣatra-s (going by "
"their mainstream identification) lie slightly outside their constellation "
"boundaries - in which case, any resultant problem (with regards to ritual "
"timing or astrology) should be solved by other means (some people propose "
"alternate identifications for such yogatārā-s).\n"
"\n"
"### Navagraha - Nine \"planets\"\n"
"\n"
"They observed that some celestial body moves independently relative to "
"background stars and named them \"planets\" or \"graha\". As such The sun "
"and moon are also treated as graha. They also named the lunar nodes as graha-"
"s as these points are very important to calculate the eclipses. Name of "
"vedic days originated from these planet's names.\n"

"Most astronomical observation in the Japan until the Meiji Restoration was "
"closely tied to astrological purposes. For ancient Chinese and later Korean "
"and Japanese cartographers four seasons and four cardinal directions is "
"marked as four talismanic animals - the Azure Dragon of the East (Spring), "
"the Red Bird of the South (Summer), the White Tiger of the West (Fall), and "
"the \"Genbu\" (Black Tortoise) of the North (Winter). Corresponding to each "
"of the talismanic animals the celestial \"palaces\" were seven *sei shuku* "
"or what are sometimes called \"lunar lodges\". The moon \"stations\" or "
"\"lodges\" probably may be used to determine position of sun and planets as "
"well as the moon, and their number may or may not have been related to the "
"period of the moon's orbit. Origins of these associations are obscure and "
"even controversial."

"Determination of the talismanic animals and associated star \"palaces\" "
"together with the associated 28 *sei shuku* or lunar lodges represent some "
"of the most complex aspects of Asian \"astronomy\". An apparent anomaly is "
"the fact that the actual positional path of the sun seems to move in a "
"direction opposite the seasonal associations of Spring and Fall. Some "
"scientists argues that this is due to the animals and sei shuku being "
"created some 17 to 18 millennia ago (precession creating the anomaly), but "
"it does not really explain the apparent \"backward\" motion of the sun "
"through seasons.\n"
"\n"
"According to some scientists, the talismanic animals with their associated "
"sei shuku were probably used in conjunction with the direction to which the "
"handle of the big dipper (often called the \"North Seven Stars\" in China, "
"Korea, and Japan) pointed at the equinoxes and solstices. Before the "
"Christian Era, when the sei shuku were created, the big dipper did not "
"appear to set, because they had a relatively \"higher\" position than now.\n"
"\n"
"Like myths and traditions in Western cultures, these views still wield "
"influence in the daily life of people in China, Korea, and Japan (this "
"despite quite prominent scientific literacy). However, it should be pointed "
"out that astrological divination in China, Korea and Japan was and is rather "
"complex.\n"
"\n"
"The lore related to moon stations is one of the most interesting aspects of "
"Asian Ethnoastronomy. Japanese interpretations of these associations tended "
"to revolve around agricultural needs and animistic views of nature. Unlike "
"many Western myths and traditions, japanese gods in the similitude of the "
"talismanic animals can be seen as manifestations of nature.\n"

"\n"
"This Stellarium Skyculture is the result of a Higher Degree Research project "
"by Robert Fuller at Macquarie University, Sydney, finishing in 2014. "
"Stellarium was chosen as a part of the project for Giving Back of the "
"collected knowledge to the Kamilaroi and Euahlayi communities in the form of "
"a documentary video (Star Stories of the Dreaming) and a student's Study "
"Guide. Clips from the Stellarium were used in the documentary to illustrate "

"##### Gawaargay\n"
"\n"
"Gawaargay is the spirit Emu in the Sky, located with its head in the Coal "
"Sack, and its neck and body stretching out through the dust lanes of the "
"Milky Way (Warrambul) past Scorpius. The Euahlayi and the Kamilaroi see it "
"with legs in April and May, when it is female and chasing the males. From "
"June to August it is male and sitting on its nest without legs (the males "
"brood the chicks), and this is a signal to collect the eggs. In the evening "
"in late August it is vertical in the sky, and the head and body form two "
"\"eggs\", meaning the eggs should not be collected. Later in the year, it "
"appears on the horizon, so it is believed to be sitting in a waterhole, "
"meaning the waterholes are full. When it is below the horizon, then it is on "
"Earth as the Black Emu, which is rarely seen.\n"
"\n"
"##### Birringoloo\n"
"\n"
"Birringoloo is the second wife of Byaame, the creator/culture hero. She sits "
"by the campfire of Byaame's camp (the star Alpha Muscae), and all women with "
"girl children who die come to this camp before going on to Bulimah (Heaven "
"behind Warrambul). They wait at this camp until all their girl children have "
"died and come to the camp, and then they can proceed to Bulimah.\n"
"\n"
"##### Yarran\n"
"\n"
"Yarran (also called mingga) is the roots of the Yarran tree, an Acacia, "
"which is the tree that Byaame took up to the Warrambul with the first man to "
"die (and the Cockatoos). It is actually centred on the Coal Sack, and the "
"dark nebula is the hollow of the tree seen from below, with the roots "
"spreading around. When someone dies and goes to Bulimah, they go through the "
"hollow of the Yarran.\n"
"\n"
"##### Old Wiringin\n"
"\n"
"A Wiringin is a \"Clever Man\" or Aboriginal doctor. This Wiringin located "
"in the Small Magellanic Cloud is there because he controls who can go on to "
"Bulimah. If the person who died is not initiated, they are not allowed, "
"because they don't know the rules, so he sends them to Wadhaagudjaaylwan in "
"the Large Magellanic Cloud. This birth spirit will send the unitiated back "
"to Earth as a new baby, so they can be initiated. This Wiringin is "
"represented in every Aboriginal cemetary as the Wilga tree (Native Willow).\n"
"\n"
"##### Birray Birray\n"
"\n"
"The Birray Birray are a group of uninitiated boys who are in love with the "
"seven young women (sisters), Miyay Miyay, who make up the Pleiades star "
"cluster. They chased the Miyay Miyay, who ended up in the sky, and for this "
"they were placed in Orion, as the three stars that make up the belt of "
"Orion. Rigel is their fire, and the sword of Orion is their fire poker. They "
"are kept from the Miyay Miyay by the Wiringin, Old Dthillar, who is "
"Aldebaran.\n"
"\n"
"##### Miyay Miyay\n"
"\n"
"The Miyay Miyay are the seven young women (sisters) who were chased into the "
"sky, depending on the story, by the Birray Birray, or by various Wiringins "
"or other bad persons. They form the Pleiades star cluster, and as one sister "
"is shy, normally we only see six stars. They are protected from the Birray "
"Birray in Orion by the Wiringin, Old Dthillar, who is Aldebaran.\n"
"\n"
"##### Old Dthillar\n"
"\n"
"Old Dthillar is a Wiringin, in this case the Wiringin of the Birray Birray, "
"the unitiated boys in Orion who pine for the Miyaay Miyaay (Seven Sisters) "
"in the Pleiades. Old Dthillar is the star Aldebaran, which is also Alpha "
"Tauri, and he stands there to protect the Miyaay Miyaay from the Birray "
"Birray. The inverted \"V\" shape made up by Alpha, Epsilon, and Gamma Tauri "
"is Old Dthillar's gunya (hut).\n"
"\n"
"##### Wamba Wamba\n"
"\n"
"\"Wamba\" means \"crazy\" or \"mad\". In this case, the star Canopus is "
"called Wamba Wamba because of various reasons, depending on whose story is "
"told. The planet Venus is also called Wamba. One speculation is that both "
"Canopus and Venus are seen close to the horizon in the summer, and due to "
"atmospheric defraction, can \"scintillate\" (twinkle srongly), which results "
"in rapid changes in colour. This might be interpreted as madness.\n"
"\n"
"##### Wadhaagudjaaylwan\n"
"\n"
"Wadhaagudjaaylwan is Byaame's third wife, who is in the Large Magellanic "
"Cloud, and sings to women who are going to have babies. She \"sings\" the "
"babies to the women on Earth, and she takes the persons that the Old "
"Wiringin in the Small Magellanic Cloud sends to her, and sends them back to "
"Earth as babies.\n"
"\n"
"##### Bandaarr\n"
"\n"
"Bandaarr is Kamilaroi/Euahlayi for Kangaroo, and this kangaroo is located "
"under the belly of the Emu in the Milky Way, looking away from the Emu. "
"Bandaarr is either a grey or red kangaroo, depending on the culture, and has "
"significance in ceremony.\n"
"\n"
"##### Muraay Muyaay\n"
"\n"
"Muraay is Kamilaroi, and Muyaay is Euahlayi for the sulfur-crested cockatoo, "
"who are the Pointer stars (Alpha Centauri and Hadar/Beta Centauri). They "
"ended up in the constellation Crux when their tree, the Yarran, was dragged "
"into the sky with the first man to die, and they are always chasing Yarran.\n"
"\n"
"##### Warrawilbaarru\n"
"\n"
"Warrawilbaarru is the whirlwind spirit who lives in the constellation "
"Scorpius. Byaame normally keeps him from coming to Earth, but in September "
"he comes out of one of three holes (dark nebulae) in Scorpius during "
"September, and doesn't go back until around March. During this time he is on "
"earth as the \"willy willy\" or whirlwind, and can be dangerous to children "
"and uninitiated men."

"### Origin\n"
"\n"
"The 272 constellations displayed in this Stellarium sky culture are based on "
"the Cheon-Sang-Yeol-Cha-Bun-Ya-Zi-Do, the Korean Constellation map, which "
"was carved on the stone on 1395 but has its origin from another sky map "
"which existed about 2,000 years ago. This map represents 1467 stars in about "
"190 constellations whose shapes are slightly different from the chinese "
"ones. The interpretation of the map is not easy: the map is so old that only "
"about 300 stars are found to match with the real stars. All the stars of the "
"map were drawn on a circle, so the equator seems smaller than the southern "
"limit. Because the density of constellation does not change with respect to "
"the position, the position and the size of the constellations were somewhat "
"altered in a way unknown by the author. It is assumed that there should be "
"no bright stars which do not belong to any constellations. The work of the "
"author is subject to interpretation, and could be changed at a later time. "
"It will however roughly show what the Korean Constellation are like."

"align=\"left\"/>The *Lokono*, also known as *Arawak*, are an indigenous "
"people of the Guianas, whose territory stretches along the coast of the "
"Atlantic Ocean, from northwestern Guyana, through Suriname, to northwestern "
"French Guiana (see map).[#1] The Lokono speak a language that belongs to the "
"Arawakan language family&mdash;one of the largest linguistic groupings on "
"the continent. Like many of their linguistic relatives, the Lokono are "
"agriculturalists specializing in the farming of manioc (*Manihot "
"esculenta*), who also practice fishing, hunting, and gathering of wild "
"plant. However, as one of the first indigenous groups that was encountered "
"by the Europeans at the time of conquest, the Lokono have been in contact "
"with non-indigenous populations for over 500 years.[#2] This contact has "
"intensified in the last century, leading to a substantial loss of the Lokono "
"language, traditional material and immaterial culture, changes in "
"subsistence practices, and in particular to the disappearance of *medicine-"
"men*&mdash;the traditional carriers of spiritual knowledge, most likely "
"including ethnoastronomical knowledge. As a consequence, the modern "
"knowledge about celestial bodies appears to be but a fraction of what the "
"Lokono knew about stars in the past. Several constellations mentioned in "
"older sources are forgotten or are only known from their names, while the "
"combinations of stars they represent and the oral traditions explaining "
"their origin and significance have been forgotten. The Skyculture presented "
"here includes only identified constellations but the following description "
"provides a more comprehensive account of Lokono astronomical knowledge "

"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical "
"knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society. "
"However, it was the medicine-men in particular&mdash;the spiritual leaders "
"of the Lokono known as *semethi*&mdash;who were required to master the "
"various aspects of star knowledge and who might have been responsible for "
"passing the oral traditions associated with them from one generation to "
"another. From Rodrigo de Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first "
"accounts of the Lokono, we learn, for instance, that:\n"
"\n"
"*&ldquo;old and wise men whom they call Cemetu assemble in the houses "
"designed for their meetings and [&hellip;] recount the traditions and "
"exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those "
"ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember "
"the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner "
"they recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, "
"and stars.&rdquo;*[#1]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's *cemetu*, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as *semethi*, "
"have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the "
"transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono "
"constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are "
"therefore often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers "
"and ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is "
"illustrated below.\n"
" <p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <figure> <img src=\"illustrations/schulz."
"png\" width=\"572\" height=\"508\" align=\"middle\"/> <p style=\"text-align:"
"center;\"><figcaption>Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa "
"1803.[#23]</figcaption></p> </figure> </p>\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar "
"knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial "
"bodies, however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a "
"mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
" - the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous "
"groups.\n"
" - the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial "
"bodies.\n"
" - the use of the term *koya* &lsquo;spirit&rsquo; in the names of numerous "
"constellations.\n"
" - the use of the general term *wiwa* &lsquo;star, year&rsquo; and the lack "
"of other astronomical terms.\n"
" - the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous "
"peoples, the Kari&rsquo;na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, "
"speaking a language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not "
"intermarrying, the three groups share a great deal of material and "
"immaterial culture. Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also "
"shows a number of striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, "
"similar names of constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This "
"speaks to the contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of "
"astronomical knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual "
"leaders, such as the Lokono *semethi*. The degree to which these traditions "
"overlap and the directionality of their exchange require further study. "
"Here, we focus on the Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural "
"borrowings in detail, unless they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell "
"of the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and "
"explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation "
"*Hithikoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the black curassow&rsquo;, for instance, is "
"linked in a Lokono myth to that of *Yokhârhin* &lsquo;Hunter&rsquo; and "
"*Al&ecirc;ti* &lsquo;Torch&rsquo;, all three of which have Kari&rsquo;na and "
"Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by the medicine-"
"men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which astronomical "
"knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this reason, "
"summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of particular "
"constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not "
"documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to "
"illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many "
"of such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, "
"this enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is "
"justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term *koya* &lsquo;spirit&rsquo;, found in numerous constellation names "
"typically following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key "
"feature of Lokono astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, "
"explains that such constellations are the spirits of the corresponding "
"beings.[#4] At a time of the year when the constellation appears, the spirit "
"travels from the sky to earth to breathe life into the beings it represents. "
"As such, the *koya*-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the "
"best time is to engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and "
"animals (e.g. hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where "
"such spirits would descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called "
"these places with the same names as the constellations but the evidence of "
"that remains poor. Thus, *Hadorhikoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the red "
"acouchi&rsquo; would refer to the spirit, the constellation, and the place "
"where the *hadorhi* is found in plenty when its constellation appears. While "
"this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the *koya*-constellations "
"remind us of the great understanding of the plant and animal life that the "
"Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. *Wiwa*, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars, "
"*wiwa*. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of *koya.* It refers, on "
"the one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on "
"the other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, "
"when talking about one&rsquo;s age. While it can apply to any star, *wiwa* "
"appears only in two proper names of celestial bodies. *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa*, "
"literally &lsquo;Scores of stars&rsquo; (Pleiades), is the most important of "
"all Lokono constellations, whose appearance traditionally commences the "
"Lokono calendar year. Following *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa* are the numerous *koya*-"
"constellations, each signaling a different season in the Lokono calendar. On "
"the other hand, *Wiwa kalemero*, literally &lsquo;Shining star&rsquo; "
"(Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness. "
"Apart from *wiwa* and *koya*, there are no generic terms distinguishing "
"planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For "
"this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is "
"included among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono "
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the "
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe "
"the rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of "
"the yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location "
"to the Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location "
"menu). It merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, "
"did not connect the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was "
"little agreement among speakers as to which star within a constellation "
"corresponds to which parts of the plant or animal it represents. In "
"Stellarium, we represent constellations with lines, but it should be kept in "
"mind that this may be a distortion of the Lokono tradition, which allows for "
"more flexibility in interpreting particular star groups. Finally, there are "
"restrictions on looking at some celestial bodies, since it is believed that "
"a spirit can harm one if looked at.[#5] For instance, by full moon, mothers "
"covered the eyes of their children so that they would not become sick.[#6] "
"Young people were also told not to look at *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa* (Pleiades), "
"or else they would not grow.[#7] Such practices applied also to other "
"objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of "
"avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into "
"one&rsquo;s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"##### *Hadali* 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is *Hadali*, also pronounced as *Adali*. "
"Claaudius de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono "
"culture hero, the first medicine-man known as *Harlitvanli*, *Haliwalika*, "
"*Halwanli*, *Hariwalli*, and *Arawanili*, and sometimes *Arawidi,* may all "
"refer to the same hero identified as the Sun.[#8] While we cannot confirm "
"this hypothesis, the myth of *Arawidi* is worth mentioning. In the Lokono "
"myth, *Arawidi*, the Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the "
"constellation *Mabukuli* &lsquo;Man without a thigh&rsquo; (Orion&rsquo;s "
"belt).[#9], [#10], [#11] According to the story, the Sun used to come to "
"earth in the shape of a man called *Arawidi* to meet his lover with whom he "
"had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins marries a woman, "
"whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to escape, the "
"wife&rsquo;s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in revenge. "
"As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation "
"*Mabukuli*. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, "
"stuck on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. "
"A boat passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to "
"help the man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard."
"[#11]. As far as practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among "
"the Lokono, the eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between *Hadali* and "
"*Kathi*, the Moon, and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of "
"noises to stop them from fighting.[#12]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Kathi* 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as *Kathi*, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as "
"*cattehee* around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month.[#13] "
"According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth "
"reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious "
"lover night after night.[#10] To find out who the lover was, the woman "
"smeared her hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she "
"woke up, she found that her brother&rsquo;s face was covered in soot and "
"realized it was him who visited her at night. Everybody in her community "
"started to avoid the incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept "
"away from the people and ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. "
"This is why, according to the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. "
"The Moon appears also in another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck "
"on an uninhabited island mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but "
"this time inside is the Moon, which decides to help the man, since people "
"are always happy to see the Moon come out at night.[#11] The Moon and Sun "
"are also depicted as opponents. In previous times, the Lokono believed that "
"the eclipse of the Moon is its death (*kathi &ocirc;don* &lsquo;moon "
"dying&rsquo;) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say during the "
"eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun&rsquo;s path."
"[#11] Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell "
"trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their "
"children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Warhokoma* 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star "
"and when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called "
"*Warhokoma* by the Lokono.[#8], [#14], [#15] Charles Dance, on the other "
"hand, reports the terms *Eweiwah* and *Huewah*, probably the equivalents of "
"the general term *wiwa* &lsquo;star&rsquo; which can be used for any shining "
"celestial body.[#16] The Lokono also speak of Venus as *Hiyaro wiwa* &lsquo;"
"women&rsquo;s star&rsquo;. In relation to this, it merits a mention that "
"Claudius de Goeje reports that when *Hiyaro wiwa* appears close to the Moon, "
"and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say that the "
"girl will soon be touched by the Moon.[#5] There is no myth about "
"*Warhokoma* specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth "
"reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a "
"man who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under "
"*Kathi*), and has a name as a womanizer.[#10] Interestingly, the name "
"*Warhokoma* for Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari&rsquo;na, who "
"see it also as the Moon's wife.[#17], [#18]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Waya nukuthi bunaha* 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as *Waya nukuthi bunaha,* literally "
"&lsquo;Path of the carriers of clay&rsquo;. The Milky Way represents the "
"footprints of men who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that "
"is, rarely if at all, practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, "
"however, is still known, and is summarized in a myth.[#19] The same name for "
"Milky Way was noted by William Brett who adds that it is named after a "
"specific whitish type of clay.[#14] Charles Dance, on the other hand, says "
"that the Milky Way represents the footprints of peccaries rooting up the "
"clay, while Walter Roth mentions a different Lokono explanation, according "
"to which the Milky way represents a tapir chased by a dog and jaguar.[#10], "
"[#16] However, these two sources do not give the corresponding Lokono name "
"for the Milky Way, and it is possible that these two explanations are a "
"Kari&rsquo;na influence, who recognize a constellation of a tiger following "
"the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky Way.[#17]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Mali* 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius *Mali*, the literal meaning of which is "
"unknown. Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called *Mali* and "
"explains that it is a very powerful star.[#7], [#17] When it comes up in the "
"morning in August, it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point "
"at it or one&rsquo;s finger will become lame. Cornelius van Coll&rsquo;s "
"*Mali* marks the beginning of the big dry season (August to December), "
"called in Lokono *malidalithe*, a term derived from *Mali*. Older sources "
"identified *Mali* tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or Crux, but given that the "
"big dry season starts around August and that the Lokono observe the stars in "
"the morning, these identifications must be incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux "
"cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono territories.[#11], [#17] There "
"are no Lokono myths about *Mali*, but there is evidence that is may "
"correspond to the Kari&rsquo;na constellation *Ombatapo* &lsquo;Previous "
"face&rsquo;. The Kari&rsquo;na myths explain the origin of the constellation "
"and its name, which, like the Lokono *Mali*, is believed to kill the fish in "
"the swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the "
"Kari&rsquo;na *Ombatapo* is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, "
"the latter of which includes Sirius.[#18], [#20]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Yôkoro wiwa* 'Scores of stars'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa* or *Wiwa y&ocirc;koro*, literally "
"&lsquo;Score of stars&rsquo;, refers to the Pleiades and is easily "
"recognized by the contemporary Lokono. This is likely because *Y&ocirc;koro "
"wiwa* is described as the most important of Lokono constellations, since it "
"announce the beginning of the Lokono year.[#17] After it comes out first in "
"June in the east, it is followed by the numerous *koya*-constellations "
"referring to the spirits of animals and plants that constitute the Lokono "
"calendar. At that time of the year, the Lokono say *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa "
"kayaran* &lsquo;the birth of *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa*&rsquo;. It is said that if "
"*Y&ocirc;koro wiwa* shines strong when it appears for the first time, many "
"people will die in the coming year.[#5] Cornelius van Coll also warns that "
"young people should not look at it, or else they will not grow.[#7] These "
"omens and warnings are related to a Lokono myth. According to the story, "
"there were once twin brothers, one of which had a wife, and said that death "
"would come when their star, *Y&ocirc;koro Wiwa*, rises.[#7] Death came "
"indeed, killing even his wife, roasting her on the fire, and the Lokono "
"became angry and brought a giant green anaconda to swallow the twins. The "
"snake ate one of the brothers, but because it was already 5 am and the day "
"broke, the snake could not eat the other brother. The snake is now the "
"constellation *Kamodokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the green anaconda&rsquo;, in "
"the belly of which *Y&ocirc;koro Wiwa* is said to be located (see also the "
"*Yorhada* myth). In another narrative, the Lokono explain that the *Y&ocirc;"
"koro Wiwa* represents seven brothers lost in a savannah on their way back "
"home, a motif also known from a Kari'na story.[#20]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Yorhada* 'Grill'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Yorhada* &lsquo;Grill&rsquo;, or *Wiwa yorhadale* &lsquo;"
"Star&rsquo;s grill&rsquo;, represents a wooden grill, on which meat is "
"roasted.[#4], [#11], [#21] Its origin is explained in a myth related by "
"Walter Roth about a man who killed his wife, roasted her, and fed her liver "
"to his mother-in-law because she called him a worthless hunter.[#10] In "
"revenge, the mother asked her brother, *Kamodo* to kill the man when he went "
"hunting. The man suspected the woman set a trap and escaped death by sending "
"his brother instead. The grill on which the wife was roasted became the "
"Western constellation Pegasus, according to contemporary Lokono, marking the "
"beginning of the small dry season (April), the time when the Lokono roast a "
"lot of fish. The myth is similar to that of *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa* and the "
"twins, in which the older brother is responsible for roasting his wife and "
"may be the same as the man who roasted his wife in the *Yorhada* myth. In "
"both myths, the younger brother killed by the anaconda becomes *Y&ocirc;koro "
"wiwa*, while the grill becomes *Yorhada*. Claudius de Goeje suggested that "
"*Yorhada* is the Western constellation Corvus, but Corvus does not appear at "
"beginning of the small dry season.[#11] The neighboring Warao also know "
"Pegasus as the grill, and are familiar with the myth.[#10]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Kamodokoya* 'Spirit of the green anaconda'\n"
"\n"
"*The constellation Kamodokoya*, &lsquo;Spirit of the green anaconda "
"(*Eunectes murinus*)', also called *Waroboshi* remains poorly described.[#5] "
"Older sources suggest it is Perseus, Pleiades, Scorpio, or Ophiuchus, but "
"the exact stars remain unidentified.[#10], [#11], [#21] Several myths "
"explain its origin. According to Walter Roth, a man killed his wife, roasted "
"her, and fed her liver to her mother because she called him a worthless "
"hunter.[#10], In revenge, she asked *Kamodo* to kill him, but the man "
"escaped the snake who ate his younger brother instead. The constellation "
"*Kamodokoya* has *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa*, the brother, inside, and is close to "
"*Yorhada* &lsquo;Grill&rsquo;, on which the wife was roasted. Notably, "
"Theodor Schultz list the constellation *Waroboshi yorhadale* 'The grill of "
"the green anaconda' which could be the same as the constellation *Yorhada*."
"[#23] Cornelius van Coll speaks of twins, one of whom had a wife, and warned "
"that their star brings death.[#7] Indeed, even his wife died, roasted on the "
"fire. The Lokono had the snake kill the man, and ascend to the sky as "
"*Kamodokoya*. Finally, Claudius de Goeje relates a myth of a woman who felt "
"a desire for men, and put a *katuburi* flower in her vagina, and became "
"pregnant. Her child was partly a snake, and people wanted to kill it, so it "
"ascended to the sky.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Kibiwarhakoya*  'Spirit of the capybara'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Kibiwarhakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the capybara&rsquo; "
"(*Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris*) was mentioned by the Penard brothers.[#17] The "
"same source also informs us that it is followed by the constellation "
"*Kamodokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the green anaconda&rsquo;. The constellation "
"remains unidentified and its significance is unknown. No related myths have "
"been documented.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Mabukuli* 'Man without a thigh'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Mabukuli* &lsquo;Man without a thigh&rsquo; is well known "
"among the Lokono and appears in a few myths. According to Charles Dance, an "
"unsuccessful huntsman cut off his own leg, wrapped it up in a leaf, and gave "
"to his step mother so that she had something to eat, and ascended to sky."
"[#16] Similarly, the Penard brothers speak of an unsuccessful hunter who cut "
"off his leg and gave it to his wife and mother-in-law, telling them it was "
"tapir meat.[#17] He then asked other people to follow his traces to help him "
"bring the rest of the tapir, but when they arrived at the place they only "
"found the *akalali* plant with which he treated his wounds. His body turned "
"into the *Kama t&acirc;la* constellation and his spirit into *Mabukuli*. "
"Claudius de Goeje relates a strikingly different myth.[#11] The Sun, once a "
"man called *Arawidi* (see the myth about *Hadali* 'Sun'), took a woman as "
"his wife, who followed him with unborn twins inside her. One day, she lost "
"the way and ended up being eaten by vulture spirits, but her twins were "
"brought up by an old woman, whom they later killed and ran away. While "
"hiding in a treetop, they saw a woman catching fish with a sifter. She saw "
"their reflection in the water and tried to catch it, at which they laughed. "
"She then realized they were up in the tree, and sent ants up the tree to "
"make them come down. When they came down, she killed one of them and took "
"the other home. One of her daughters fell in love with the man and married "
"him. Now the husband had to catch a lot of fish every day for the mother-in-"
"law. One day, tired of his demanding mother-in-law, he tricked her into "
"getting into the water to help him unload a boat full of fish, where she was "
"eaten by a shark. When her other daughter arrived, the liver of her mother "
"was still floating on the water and told her that the man killed her. The "
"daughter wanted to kill him but he flew away on wings of cotton that his "
"wife made for him, so she only cut his thigh off, which is why he is now the "
"constellation *Mabukuli*. It appears the Orion's belt represents the cut-off "
"leg, not the man himself.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Kama tâla* 'Jaw of the tapir'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Kama t&acirc;la* &lsquo;Jaw of the tapir&rsquo; is one of "
"the few constellations identified easily by the contemporary Lokono, just "
"like *Mabukuli*, to which it is related in a myth.[#8], [#15] The Penard "
"brothers recount the story of an unsuccessful hunter, who cuts meat off his "
"leg and gives it to his wife and mother-in-law, telling them it is tapir "
"meat (*Tapirus terrestris*).[#17] He then asks his fellow people to follow "
"him and help bring the rest of the tapir, but when they arrive at the place "
"they only find the *akalali* plant with which he treated his wounds. His "
"body turned into *Kama t&acirc;la* and his spirit into *Mabukuli*. In a "
"Kari&rsquo;na story, on the other hand, *Kama t&acirc;la* was the remains of "
"a tapir that the mythical twins were hunting, one of whom accidentally gets "
"his leg severed and becomes the constellation of man without a thigh.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Hithikoya* 'Spirit of the black curassow'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Hithikoya* is the &lsquo;Spirit of the black "
"curassow&rsquo; (*Crax alector*), a commonly hunted bird, often kept as a "
"pet for its feathers and eggs. According to a Lokono myth, *Hithikoya* lived "
"on earth, but the Lokono kept shooting him.[#11] As a result, he ascended to "
"the sky to warn black curassows about the approaching hunter (see "
"*Yokh&acirc;rhin*) and his companion with a torch (see *Al&ecirc;ti*). The "
"Lokono identify *Hithikoya* as the Western constellation Crux. When it "
"appears just above the trees in January, the curassows roam on the ground "
"and are easy to catch. Over the following months, the higher *Hithikoya* "
"rises in the morning, the higher the birds climb up the trees. By March, it "
"appears high in the sky and the birds are found in the tops of the trees. "
"*Hithikoya* thus informs the Lokono where to search for the birds at a given "
"time of the year. The Lokono even make hunting charms (*bina*) from a plant, "
"whose leaves resemble the bird, rubbed into the lips of the hunter so that "
"he can imitate the calls of the bird, increasing his chances of catching one."
"[#10], [#17]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Yokhârhin* 'Hunter'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Yokh&acirc;rhin* &lsquo;Hunter&rsquo; corresponds to "
"&alpha; Centauri and represents the man hunting *Hithikoya*, the &lsquo;"
"Spirit of the black curassow&rsquo; (see *Hithikoya*).[#9], [#10], [#11] His "
"companion holding a torch known as *Al&ecirc;ti* is represented by &beta; "
"Centauri. The myth reported by the Penard brothers that explains the origin "
"of *Hithikoya* includes also these two characters.[#11] According to the "
"story, *Hithikoya* used to live on earth, but the Lokono kept tracking him "
"down at night and shoot him. As a result, it ascended to the sky to serve as "
"a signal for black curassows warning them about the approaching hunter "
"(*Yokh&acirc;rhin*) and his companion with a torch (*Al&ecirc;ti*). As "
"*Hithikoya* appears higher and higher in the morning between January and "
"March, *Yokh&acirc;rhin* and subsequently *Al&ecirc;ti* appear on the "
"horizon following it. This indicates to the Lokono that the black curassow "
"can now be found high in the tress and the hunters can set out at night to "
"hunt it in the tree tops.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Alêti* 'Torch'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation&nbsp;*Al&ecirc;ti* &lsquo;Torch&rsquo; corresponds to&nbsp;"
"&beta; Centauri and represents the companion of the hunter *Yokh&acirc;"
"rhin*, holding a torch torch made from a piece of cloth dipped in beeswax "
"known as *Al&ecirc;ti*.[#9], [#10], [#11]&nbsp; *Al&ecirc;ti* follows "
"*Yokh&acirc;rhin* so as not to scare the black curassow bird with the light "
"of the torch. The myth reported by the Penard brothers that explains the "
"origin of *Hithikoya* 'Spirit of the black curassow' includes also these two "
"characters (see *Hithikoya*).[#11] According to the story, *Hithikoya* used "
"to live on earth, but the Lokono kept tracking him down at night and shoot "
"him. As a result, it ascended to the sky to serve as a signal for black "
"curassows warning them about the approaching hunter (*Yokh&acirc;rhin*) and "
"his companion with a torch (*Al&ecirc;ti*). As *Hithikoya* appears higher "
"and higher in the morning between January and March, *Yokh&acirc;rhin* and "
"subsequently *Al&ecirc;ti* appear on the horizon following it. This "
"indicates to the Lokono that the black curassow can now be found high in the "
"tress and the hunters can set out at night to hunt it in the tree tops.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Anorhâkoya* 'Spirit of the cocoi heron'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Anorh&acirc;koya* represents the spirit of the cocoi "
"heron (*Ardea cocoi*). It is recognized by contemporary Lokono as Ursa "
"Major, in keeping with earlier identifications.[#11], [#15] Claudius de "
"Geoje reports that when it shines strong, the Lokono believe that strong "
"winds will come, bringing dust into peoples&rsquo; eyes and consequently "
"diseases: the heron picks their eyes with its beak, it is said.[#11] "
"Similarly, according to Cornelius van Coll, *Anorh&acirc;koya* is a heron "
"whose beak is upside down. Should its beak be turned downwards, people would "
"get all kinds of eye diseases.[#7] This can still happen when strong winds "
"blow and carry the light from the beak into peoples&rsquo; eyes, since the "
"light of *Anorh&acirc;koya* (and other stars) travels with the wind "
"according to the Lokono. The constellation is associated with the big dry "
"season (August to December) and the storms and winds that are typical of "
"this time. It appears in the morning in mid-November in the northeast with "
"its beak down.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Honolikoya* 'Spirit of the rufescent tiger heron'\n"
"\n"
"Another Lokono constellation named after a species of a heron is "
"*Honolikoya* &lsquo;*Spirit of the rufescent tiger heron*&rsquo; (*Tigrisoma "
"lineatum*). It is reported in historical sources as the equivalent of the "
"Kari&rsquo;na constellation *Kumawari yumï* (&lsquo;Father of the cocoi "
"heron&rsquo;). This is likely a mistake as *honoli* is a different and well-"
"known species of a heron. It is possible that *Honolikoya* refers to the "
"same constellation as *Anorhâkoya*, interpreted differently by different "
"Lokono consultants, but it is also possible it is a different constellation. "
"In any case, *Honolikoya* remains unidentified.[#17] Just like *Anorh&acirc;"
"koya*, the constellation is said to bring diseases of the eyes when it "
"appears in the morning sky. From the Penard brothers' description we can "
"infer that *Honolikoya* should appear between June and the big dry season, "
"which lasts from end of August until the beginning of December. There "
"appears to be no specific myth associated with this constellation.[#17]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Kasorhowakoya* 'Spirit of the four-eyed fish'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Kasorhowakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the four-eyed fish&rsquo; "
"(*Anableps anableps*) was identified by the contemporary Lokono as &lambda; "
"Scorpii and &upsilon; Scorpii. In earlier sources it is identified as the "
"upper part of Scorpio&rsquo;s tail, which is in keeping with the 21st "
"century data.[#8] The constellation represents the two eyes of the four-eyed "
"fish, which is known for the fact that its eyes are always sticking above "
"the water, and is therefore sometimes considered an incarnation of the water "
"spirit. There is no Lokono myth concerning the four-eyed fish, and it "
"remains unknown what the appearance of this constellation signifies. "
"However, it merits a mention that the Kari&rsquo;na have a constellation "
"representing the same fish, which corresponds to the same two stars. "
"Maga&ntilde;a and Jara explain that the appearance of the Kari&rsquo;na "
"constellation announces the fishing season for this species.[#18] It is not "
"unlikely that the Lokono constellation had the same function.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Katarhokoya* 'Spirit of the green sea turtle'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Katarhokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the green sea turtle&rsquo; "
"is still known on the Pomeroon River in Guyana. It represents the *katarho* "
"turtle (*Chelonia mydas*), swimming towards the shore, represented in turn "
"by the Milky Way. When the constellation appears in the morning high in the "
"sky, it is a signal that turtles are arriving on the beaches to lay eggs. "
"The constellation was identified in earlier sources as *Corona Borealis* and "
"*Orion's belt.* [#8], [#11] While the former overlaps with the stars "
"indicated by the Lokono on the Pomeroon, the latter is likely a mistake as "
"*Orion&rsquo;s belt* is consistently recognized as *Mabukuli* &lsquo;Man "
"without a thigh&rsquo;. The constellation *Katarhokoya* rises early in the "
"year, but it appears upside down most of the time from the vistas of the "
"Lokono in the Guianas. Only by mid-March, a time when several species of "
"turtles indeed lay their eggs on the Atlantic coast of the Guianas, does it "
"look like a turtle swimming to the shore (Milky Way).\n"
"\n"
"##### *Hikorhikoya* 'Spirit of the yellow-footed tortoise'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Hikorhikoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the yellow-footed "
"tortoise&rsquo; was documented by the Penard brothers for the Lokono in "
"Suriname; it remains unidentified but it should appear around August (i.e. "
"around the beginning of the big dry season).[#11], [#17] The Penard brothers "
"explain that when the water in the swamps rises, the yellow-footed tortoise, "
"known in Lokono as *hikorhi* (*Chelonoidis denticulatus*), seeks higher "
"grounds, and, presumably, can be more easily found. There are no myths "
"related to the constellation specifically. However, it is worth pointing out "
"that the tortoise is considered a delicacy among the Lokono. When caught, "
"they are often kept around the house in small corrals for long periods of "
"time until they are consumed. The Lokono joke that they are &lsquo;"
"fridges&rsquo; since if fed, the tortoise will stay alive for a long time, "
"as opposed to an animal that was shot and has to be prepared and eaten "
"immediately.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Kwakoya* 'Spirit of the blue crab'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Kwakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the blue crab&rsquo; is still "
"known in the Lokono communities closer to the coast, which practice the "
"annual crab feats. The crab species is likely the same as that represented "
"by the Kari&rsquo;na constellation *Kusa yumï* &lsquo;Father of the blue "
"crab&rsquo; (*Ucides cordatus*). The constellation appears in the east in "
"the middle of July. By the beginning of August, it is high in the sky, "
"signaling that the crabs arrive at the beaches to lay their eggs. At this "
"time, the Lokono and other indigenous groups of the area congregate to the "
"shore of the Atlantic to catch the marching crabs. The crabs are considered "
"a delicacy and when the villagers return to the communities with the catch, "
"large feasts are organized during which the crabs are eaten. The Penard "
"brothers write that *Kwakoya* appears when the crabs come to lay their eggs "
"in May and June but this appears to be incorrect, both given that crabs "
"march later and that the constellation recognized by the modern Lokono is "
"not visible in May and June from the Guianas.[#17]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Ifakoya* 'Spirit of the Muscovy duck'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Ifakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the Muscovy duck&rsquo; "
"(*Cairina moschata*) was mentioned by the Penard brothers and Claudius de "
"Goeje but remained unidentified until now.[#11], [#17] The contemporary "
"Lokono on the Pomeroon River in Guyana recognize it in parts of the Western "
"constellation Corona Australis. There are no myths related to this "
"constellation but the Lokono say that when the head of the duck points "
"toward the ground, looking as if the duck has its head under the water, the "
"ducks are busy feeding on plants. The constellation assumes this position "
"from mid-May. At this time, it is said that the birds are easier to catch. "
"The Muscovy duck is considered a delicacy and is also often kept around the "
"house like chickens. The Kari'na and the Warao also recognize the "
"constellation of the Muscovy duck, and at least the Warao one corresponds to "
"the same stars.[#17]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Awarhakoya* 'Spirit of the awara palm'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Awarhakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the awara palm&rsquo; has "
"the shape of an awara palm (*Astrocaryum vulgare*). Its appearance high in "
"the sky in January means that awara fruits are ripening. In the following "
"months, *Awarhakoya* moves closer to the horizon, meaning that the fruits "
"will soon fall to the ground to be picked. This occurs in the small dry "
"season (mid-February to April), known as *awarhadlithe*, a term derived from "
"the name of the palm.[#7], [#17] There are no myths about *Awarhakoya* but "
"it is said that the constellation is followed by that of the *Hadorhikoya* "
"&lsquo;Spirit of the red acouchi&rsquo; and *Hokorherokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of "
"the red-rumped agouti&rsquo;. Their appearance signals that the rodents are "
"gathering by the palms to eat the fallen fruit. *Awarhakoya* is recognized "
"today in stars close to the Western constellation Coma Berenices, but older "
"sources suggest it is near Sirius.[#11] It is the only constellation named "
"after a plant, which speaks to the importance of the awara palm to the "
"Lokono. The Kari'na also have a constellation of the awara, sometimes "
"recognized in the same stars.[#17], [#20]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Hadorhikoya* 'Spirit of the red acouchi'\n"
"\n"
"The unidentified constellation *Hadorhikoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the red "
"acouchi&rsquo; (*Myoprocta acouchy*) was mentioned by the Penard brothers."
"[#17] It should follow the constellation *Awarhakoya* appearing near it "
"sometime after February. Its appearance signals that the ripe fruits of the "
"palm attract the red acouchi to the awara grooves, where they can be hunted. "
"There is no Lokono myth about *Hadorhikoya*, but a Kari&rsquo;na myth about "
"the unidentified Kari&rsquo;na constellation of the red acouchi relates it "
"to the several other constellations. According to the story, there were two "
"brothers, of which one had a wife. The unmarried brother killed his brother, "
"fed his liver to the wife, took her as his wife, and had a child with her. "
"The spirit of the dead brother told the woman that his brother killed him, "
"so she and her child decided to run away and ascend to the sky as the "
"constellation of the agouti and acouchi. The spirit also told his brother to "
"cut open his corpse and scatter his insides, which became the Pleiades, "
"while the killer became the constellation of the anaconda.[#11]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Hakorherokoya* 'Spirit of the red-rumped agouti'\n"
"\n"
"The unidentified constellation *Hokorherokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the red-"
"rumped agouti&rsquo; was mentioned by the Penard brothers, who explain that "
"like *Hadorhikoya*, it follows *Awarhakoya*.[#17] It signals that the ripe "
"fruit attracts the agouti (*Dasyprocta leporina*) to the awara palms, where "
"they can be hunted. Claudius de Goeje adds that it is followed by "
"*Kabadarokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the tiger&rsquo;, which, like humans, knows "
"agouti's habits.[#11] There is no Lokono myth about *Hokorherokoya*, but a "
"Kari&rsquo;na myth about the unidentified constellation of the agouti "
"explains its origin. According to the story, there were two brothers, one "
"married, the other not. The unmarried one killed the other, fed his liver to "
"the wife, took her as his wife, and had a child with her. The dead brother's "
"spirit told her that his brother killed him, so she and her child ran away, "
"becoming the agouti and acouchi constellations. The spirit then told his "
"brother to open his corpse and scatter his insides, which became the "
"Pleiades, while the killer became the anaconda constellation.[#11]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Kabadarokoya* 'Spirit of the jaguar'\n"
"\n"
"*Kabadarokoya* or *Arhwakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the jaguar&rsquo; was "
"mentioned by the Penard brothers, who link it to a Lokono myth.[#7], [#11] "
"According to the story, *Kabadaro* (*Panthera onca*) was the father of "
"*Korhirhwathe* (*Leopardus species*), whom he loved so much, he did not want "
"to marry her out.[#33] One day a thorn got stuck in his paw and a man helped "
"him take it out, so he gave the man his daughter as his wife. The family "
"always had meat, so other people were jealous and told the man that his wife "
"cheated on him. He started mistreating her. When the jaguar learned about "
"this, he ran away with his daughter but the man followed them everywhere, so "
"finally they ascended to the sky. But when the Lokono kill a jaguar, they "
"can come back to earth to kill people. According to Claudius de Goeje, it "
"follows the agouti star, a delicacy of the jaguars.[#11] The constellation "
"is unidentified. The Kari&rsquo;na constellation of the jaguar is said to "
"appear around the small dry season, when jaguars roar more because they "
"suffer from insects.[#17], [#20]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Korhirhwathekoya* 'Spirit of the ocelot'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Korhirhwathe* &lsquo;Spirit of the ocelot&rsquo; was "
"mentioned by the Penard brothers, who link it to the same Lokono myth "
"summarized above for *Kabadarokoya*.[#11] According to the story, *Kabadaro* "
"(*Panthera onca*) was the father of *Korhirhwathe* (*Leopardus species*), "
"whom he loved so much, he did not want to marry her out. However, one day a "
"thorn got stuck in his paw and a man helped him take it out, so he gave the "
"man his daughter as his wife. The family always had plenty of meat, so other "
"people became jealous and told the man that his wife cheated on him. As a "
"result, he started mistreating *Korhirhwathe*. When the jaguar learned about "
"this, he took his daughter, and ran away with her into the forest, but the "
"man followed them everywhere, so finally they ascended to the sky becoming "
"constellations. Now, when the Lokono kill a jaguar, they can come back to "
"earth to kill people.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Hawkoya* 'Spirit of the pale-throated sloth'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Hawkoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the pale-throated sloth&rsquo; "
"was mentioned by Claudius de Goeje.[#11] It represents a species of a sloth "
"(*Bradypus tridactylus*) and is an omen of storms and windy weather that "
"occur at the beginning of the big dry season (between August and December). "
"At this time, the sloths start to wander about more, and the Lokono say that "
"it is because of the winds.[#17] The constellation remains unidentified.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Warhemedokoya*  'Spirit of the two-toed sloth'\n"
"\n"
"Similarly, *Warhemedokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the two-toed sloth&rsquo;, "
"mentioned by the Penard brothers, is said to appear when the storms and "
"winds of the big dry season are about to start and make the sloths move "
"about more.[#17] It represents the two-toed sloth (*Choloepus didactylus*). "
"The constellation remains unidentified.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Yôwanakoya*  'Spirit of the green iguana'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Y&ocirc;wanakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the green "
"iguana&rsquo; is mentioned by the Penard brothers.[#17] It represents the "
"green iguana (*Iguana iguana*) and appears when the iguanas lay their eggs "
"in the sand, which should be sometime in April and May, but the "
"constellation remains unidentified.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Yarheyarherokoya*  'Spirit of the lilac-tailed parrot'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Yarheyarherokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the lilac-tailed "
"parrot&rsquo; (*Touit batavicus*) was mentioned by Claudius de Goeje.[#11] "
"The constellation is not known to contemporary Lokono; neither do we know "
"what its appearance used to signify.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Marodirokoya*  'Spirit of the marail guan'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Marodikoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the marail guan&rsquo; was "
"mentioned by Claudius de Goeje, who comments that it has the shape of the "

"contemporary Lokono; neither do we know what its appearance used to "
"signify.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Hikarowanakoya*  'Spirit of the little cuckoo'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Hikarowanakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the little cuckoo&rsquo; "
"was only mentioned by Claudius de Goeje.[#11] It represents the little "
"cuckoo (*Coccycua minuta*). The constellation remains unidentified; neither "
"do we know what its appearance used to signify. However, the Penard brothers "
"mention the Kari&rsquo;na constellation of a cuckoo species identified as "
"the very similar *Piaya cayana*.[#17], [#22] The Kari'na constellation is "
"said to bring luck to hunters. Interestingly, the Lokono link hunter&rsquo;s "
"luck to the little cuckoo as well. They say that if the bird passes you "
"calling *pikwan pikwan pikwan*, you have to watch out, as something bad "
"might happen to you.\n"
"\n"
"##### *S&ucirc;tukoya*  'Spirit of the red-handed tamarin'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *S&ucirc;tukoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the red-handed "
"tamarin&rsquo; (*Saguinus midas*) was mentioned by Cornelius van Coll and "
"the Penard brothers but it remains poorly identified.[#7], [#11], [#43] "
"According to Claudius de Goeje, it should correspond to the Western "
"constellation Coma Berenices.[#17] It is not clear whether this is correct, "
"however, given that today we find the constellation *Awarhakoya* in this "
"part of the sky, which is easily recognized by numerous speakers. There are "
"no myths related to this constellation.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Howakoya*  'Spirit of the white-faced saki'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Howakoya* 'Spirit of the white-faced saki&rsquo; was only "
"mentioned by de Claudius de Goeje.[#17] It represents the spirit of white-"
"faced saki (*Pithecia pithecia*) but the constellation and its significance "
"remain unknown.[#44]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Imenarikoya*  'Spirit of the scorpion'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Imenarikoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the scorpion&rsquo; was "
"only mentioned by Claudius de Goeje.[#11] The constellation refers to a "
"spirit of an unidentified species of a large poisonous scorpion. There are "
"no known myths about *Imenarikoya*. The constellation could be a case of "
"cultural borrowing from non-indigenous populations, as has been suggested "
"for the Kari'na constellation representing a scorpion.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Maraka*  'Rattle of the medicine-man'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation  *Maraka*  'Rattle of the medicine-man' was mentioned by "
"Claudius de Goeje, and refers to a rattle used by the Lokono medicine-men, "
"which is made of a calabash pierced with a stick, adorned with feathers of a "
"certain parrot, and filled with numerous small crystals, each of which "
"harbors a different spirit, that is a different type of *koya*.[#11] The "
"constellation remains unidentified; there is no Karin'a or Warao equivalent "
"and there are no myths related to it.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Shimarhabokoya*  'Spirit of the bow and arrow' and  *Arakabosakoya*  "
"'Spirit of the gun'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Shimarhabokoya* ‘Spirit of the bow and arrow’ and "
"*Arakabosakoya* ‘Spirit of the gun’ were mentioned by Claudius de Goeje."
"[#11] Both constellations remain unidentified and do not have Kari’na and "
"Warao counterparts, and there are no myths related to them.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Korherokoya*  'Spirit of the parrot'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation&nbsp;*Korherokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the parrot&rsquo; was "
"only mentioned by Claudius de Goeje.[#11] The constellation refers to a "
"spirit of an unidentified species of a parrot, but it was mentioned as the "
"equivalent of the Kari’na constellation *Kurewako yumï* ‘Father of the "
"orange-winged parrot’, representing the orange-winged parrot (*Amazona "
"amazonica*). There are no known myths about *Korherokoya*. It should appear "
"in February when the parrots are big enough to be taken out of their nests, "
"but the constellation remains unidentified.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Kasipenikoya*  'Spirit of the sea turtle'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Kasipenikoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the sea turtle&rsquo; was "
"mentioned by Claudius de Goeje.[#11] It refers to the spirit of an "
"unidentified species of a turtle. It may be the case that it is the same as "
"*Katarokoya*. The term *kataro* (*Chelonia mydas*) appears to be a term "
"borrowed from Kari&rsquo;na, it is thus possible that *kasipeni* is the "
"original Lokono term for the same turtle. However, there are several species "
"of turtles in the Guianas, thus *kataro* and *kasipeni* can also refer to "
"different species, and their spirits be identified with different "
"constellations."

"villages in Republic of Macedonia have been visited and over 1500 "
"inhabitants have been interviewed and surveyed. All collected information "
"from the population have been published in the book “Sky over "

msgid ""
"##### Mother Hen (Kvachka) *[Quatʃka]*\n"
"\n"
"is the best-known constellation, which is recognized by all elderly people "
"in Macedonian villages, without any exception. This name people use for the "
"star cluster Pleiades\n"
"\n"
"##### Rooster (Petal) *[Petel]*\n"
"\n"
"This is the name of the star Alnath (or Elnath) from the constellation "
"Taurus.\n"
"\n"
"##### Hawk (Јastreb) *[Yastreb]*\n"
"\n"
"Hawk, as one of the most famous enemies of the Mother Hen and the Rooster, "
"is right above them in an attacking position. Bright star Capella (Kapela) "
"from the constellation Auriga is actually known among people as Hawk.\n"
"\n"
"##### Fox (Lisica) *[Lysitsa]*\n"
"\n"
" Fox is the second by importance natural enemy of the Mother Hen and the "
"Rooster so it is obvious why people also “see” it on the sky. The red color "
"of the bright star Aldebaran from the constellation of the Bull is the "
"reason why people perceive it as a Fox ready to attack the Mother Hen and "
"the Rooster.\n"
"\n"
"##### Pigs (Svinji) *[Sviƞi]*\n"
"\n"
"Near to the Mother Hen, people on the sky noticed the star cluster Hyades. "
"Scattered appearance of the stars of this cluster associated people to the "
"image of pigs in a village yard, and so it’s called Pigs.\n"
"\n"
"##### Yoke (Jarem) *[Yarem]*\n"
"\n"
"People under this name recognize group of stars in the constellation "
"Perseus. Yokes for the oxen usually is found in village yards so that is "
"why, like the previous constellation, is evidence of the general image of "
"people and purpose given to this part of the sky.\n"
"\n"
"##### Ploughman (Orach) *[Oratʃ]*\n"
"\n"
"The Ploughman is one of the three main characters in the sky. It is the name "
"people gave to the bright star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion. "
"Besides Betelgeuse, in building the image of this folk constellation, some "
"weaker and less bright stars from the surrounding are also taken into "
"account, because people say that the Ploughman is an image of a person with "
"a goad as he returns home.\n"
"\n"
"##### Plough with Oxen (Ralo so Volovi) *[Ralɔ sɔ Vɔlɔvi]*\n"
"\n"
"The constellation Orion with its numerous bright stars and distinctive "
"pattern dominates the winter sky and can be easily found. People from "
"Macedonian villages usually point at the region around Orion’s belt saying "
"that three bright stars and surrounding less bright stars create an image of "
"a wooden Plough with two yoked oxen.\n"
"\n"
"##### Wolves (Volci) *[Voltsi]*\n"
"\n"
" Near to the plough with oxen, which is left on a field, people see two "
"wolves as well. They are the bright stars Sirius in the constellation Canis "

"to see the threshing floor with straw from where the Priest was stealing "
"from his Godson.\n"
"\n"
"##### Cross (Krst) *[Krst]*\n"
"\n"
"Complement with the people’s belief, when the Priest-thief saw God’s might "
"he started running in panic and lost his cross on the way. So next to the "
"Priest’s Straw there is the Cross.\n"
"\n"
"##### Ears (Ushi) *[Uʃi]*\n"
"\n"
"By this common word used as a jargon, Macedonian villagers mark the part of "
"the wooden plough that goes into the soil, used for plowing.\n"
"\n"
"##### Trivet (Pirustija) *[Pirustiya]*\n"
"\n"
"The trivet is a metal device with three legs (tripod) which fits over the "
"fireplace to support pans and kettles while preparing food.\n"
"\n"
"##### Tongs (Mashi) *[Maʃy]*\n"
"\n"
"The Tongs were used for the fire where the trivet is. Thus, the people’s "
"constellation Tongs is very close to the constellation Trivet.\n"
"\n"
"##### Low round wooden dining table (Sofra) *[Sofra]*\n"
"\n"
"The typical semi-circular shape of the constellation Corona Borealis evoked "
"the image of a wooden round table called sofra.\n"

"\n"
"People say that this is a very big drill used for construction of houses and "
"is found inside the Priest’s Straw\n"
"\n"
"##### Thieves (Aramii) *[Arami:]*\n"
"\n"
"The famous constellation Ursa Major among the people is described as a group "
"of thieves. The seven bright stars of Ursa Major are said to be thieves "
"„because during the entire night they circle on the sky same as thieves that "
"circle around houses“"
msgstr ""

"\n"
"老鷹是公雞和母雞的敵人，在雞的上方盤旋。 禦夫座的亮星五車二被稱為老鷹\n"
"\n"
"##### 狐狸 (Lisica) *[Lysitsa]*\n"
"\n"
" 狐狸是母雞和公雞的重要天敵之一，所以很明顯為什麼人們也會在天空中“看到”它。畢"
"宿五紅色是人們認為它是狐狸準備攻擊母雞和公雞的原因。\n"
"\n"
"##### 豕豬 (Svinji) *[Sviƞi]*\n"
"\n"
" 畢星團。人們把這個星團的恒星分散的外觀與村莊裡的豬的形象聯繫起來，因此它被稱"
"為豕豬。\n"

"\n"
" 英仙座的一群恒星，通常在村莊的院子裡發現牛軛。\n"
"\n"
"##### 農夫 (Orach) *[Oratʃ]*\n"
"\n"
"參宿四和附近的一些暗星。這是一個農夫拿著犁回家的形象。\n"
"\n"
"##### 耕犁和耕牛 (Ralo so Volovi) *[Ralɔ sɔ Vɔlɔvi]*\n"
"\n"
"獵戶星座擁在冬日的天空中占主導地位，很容易找到。自馬其頓村莊的人們通常指著獵"
"戶座帶周圍的地區，說獵戶座腰帶三星和周圍不那麼明亮的恒星形成一個木制耕犁的形"
"象，有兩頭耕牛\n"
"\n"
"##### 灰狼 (Volci) *[Voltsi]*\n"
"\n"
" 耕牛附近有兩頭灰狼，他們是天狼星和南河三.\n"

"\n"
" 夏日銀河的名字\n"
"\n"
"##### 打穀場 (Gumno) *[Goumno]*\n"
"\n"
" 仙女座星系（М31）的圓形和霧狀外觀引起人的注意，人們看到了牧師從他的神子那裡"
"偷走麥稈的打穀場\n"
"\n"
"##### 十字架 (Krst) *[Krst]*\n"
"\n"
"與人民的信仰相輔相成，當牧師小偷看到上帝的威力時，他開始驚慌失措並在途中失去"
"了他的十字架。 所以在牧師的稻草旁邊有十字架。\n"
"\n"
"##### 犁刀 (Ushi) *[Uʃi]*\n"

"The modern sky culture divides the celestial sphere into 88 areas of various "
"sizes called constellations, each with precise boundary, issued by the "
"International Astronomical Union in 1922. These constellations have become "
"the standard way to describe the sky, replacing similar sets in other sky "
"cultures exhaustively in daily usage.\n"
"\n"
"The constellations in use today are based mainly on ancient Greek "
"constellations depicted by Ptolemy in his book the Almagest during the 2nd "
"century CE. In the subsequent centuries, this book has been translated from "
"Greek into Arabic (6th to 9th century) and later to medieval Latin. In the "
"Arabic more than in the Latin tradition, the Ptolemaic figures were enriched "
"and transformed by native Arabic constellations and star names.\n"
"\n"
"In the 16-18th centuries, European astronomers suggested new constellations "
"to fill the gaps between northern constellations (e.g. the constellation of "
"\"the lynx\" for an area close to the Great Bear but with stars so faint "
"that you would need the eyes of a lynx to see them) and also created new "
"constellations in the southern part of the sky which had not been visible to "
"Ptolemy. These new constellations were usually named after new technical "
"inventions of the early modern period (e.g. a chemical furnace, a balloon, "
"an air pump) or exotic animals (e.g. a chamaeleon, a tucan, a paradise "
"bird). Among them several constellations were also named with political "
"consideration to honor certain kings or patrons.\n"
"\n"
"In the beginning of the 20th century, the IAU (International Astronomical "
"Union) aimed for a large clean-up: in 1922, it officially accepted the list "
"of 88 constellation names. In 1928 it also defined precise constellation "
"boundaries [#40] still in use today.\n"
"\n"
"### Extras\n"
"\n"
"In the 2nd century CE, Ptolemy in Alexandria published a multi-volume book "
"which summarised the astronomical knowledge of the time, rooted in a "
"tradition of mathematical astronomy since Hipparchus (at least 265 years "
"earlier). In the subsequent centuries, this book has been translated from "
"Greek into Arabic (6th to 9th century), from Arabic into Latin, and later, "
"from the original ancient Greek into medieval Latin. Due to this "
"transformation, it is now known under the artificial name Almagest, derived "
"from the Arabic title [#46].\n"
"\n"
"The Almagest star catalogue (books VII and VIII) has been depicted many "
"times in the Islamic as well as in the Christian astronomical traditions. "
"Often, the figures were re-drawn in order to adapt them to the taste of art "
"of the epoch. In the Arabic more than in the Latin tradition, the Ptolemaic "
"figures were enriched and transformed by native Arabic constellations and "
"star names. Therefore, this sky culture displays a modern descendant of the "
"Ptolemaic one with traces of translations, misunderstandings, "
"transformations, and deliberate additions.\n"
"\n"
"In 1603 the lawyer and hobby astronomer Johann Bayer from Augsburg, Germany, "
"made a new celestial atlas, called Uranometria [#41]. In this atlas, he "
"introduced a systematic naming of stars starting with alpha, the brightest, "
"beta, the second brightest, gamma, the third ... within a constellation. "
"Subsequently, it was established to name a star with a Greek letter and the "
"Latin constellation name in casus genitive.\n"
"\n"
"In the 18th century, the century of great atlases (Flamsteed, Fortin, Bode: "
"[#42][#43]), new constellations were added to fill the gaps between northern "
"constellations. Additionally, there were suggestions to create new "
"constellations in the southern part of the sky which had not been visible to "
"Ptolemy. European astronomers visited the European colonies and instead of "
"asking the native people for their constellations, the Europeans were "
"creative. This way, many new technical inventions of the early modern period "
"were depicted in constellations (e.g. a chemical furnace, a balloon, an air "
"pump) as well as exotic animals (e.g. a chamaeleon, a tucan, a paradise "
"bird).\n"
"\n"
"The problem was that sometimes astronomers did not agree with each other "
"and, thus, atlases showed deviations from each other.\n"
"\n"
"After many centuries of astronomers taking liberties in interpretation of "
"the Ptolemaic original, there were many variants of constellations. As "
"constellations are a positioning system, i.e. astronomers describe positions "
"in the sky relative to stars and stars relative to constellations (like "
"\"Betelgeuse\", Orion's right shoulder), it is necessary to use "
"constellation names and star names uniformly all over the world.\n"
"\n"
"In the \"Fin de siècle\", there were upcoming suggestions in the "
"astronomical community to unify the system of constellations and star names "
"[#44].\n"
"\n"
"The IAU, only founded in 1919, in 1928 defined the boundaries of these areas "
"[#43] and not the way of drawing artwork or connecting lines within them. "
"Consequently several sub-cultures of painting figures and drawing simplified "
"stickfigures were developed during the 20th and 21st century. We provide "
"some of them as further sky cultures.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"These constellations are based mainly on the Ptolemaic tradition which had "
"been used in all three Abrahamitic religions and, thus, was common in the "
"Near East, in Europe and its colonies on all continents. However, between "
"the ancient Greek constellations there were gaps of areas with only faint "
"stars belonging to no constellation.[#47] In the Modern Epoch, several "
"astronomers suggested constellation figures for these gaps, among them "
"several political constellations to the honor of certain kings or patrons. "
"In the late 19th century, the astronomical research community aimed for a "
"huge clean-up to avoid ambiguities in assigning stars to constellations.\n"
"\n"
"In 1922, the IAU officially approved the list of 88 constellation names and "
"their official abbreviations with three letters. The only remaining "
"political constellation is Scutum, the shield of a Polish king but without "
"mentioning the political reference anymore. The Belgian priest E. Delporte "
"got the task to define constellation boundaries according to coordinates. In "
"1928, he finished the work, based on an atlas from Argentina [#51], and the "
"IAU accepted his delimitations [#40].\n"
"\n"
"These \"constellations\" are naked areas in the sky without any stick "
"figures or depictions [#44]. The borders simply follow the lines of right "
"ascension and declination from the epoch 1875.0. Precession causes a slowly "
"increasing deviation from the originally rectilinear grid. These "
"constellations became the standard way to describe the sky, replacing "
"similar sets in other sky cultures exhaustively in daily usage.\n"
"\n"
"Stellarium by default displays the precise RA-DEC-boundaries and a set of "
"artwork constellations on the basis of Ptolemaic figures but following our "
"contemporary taste of art.\n"
"\n"
"### Asterisms\n"
"\n"
"The term \"asterism\" (assembly of stars) can sometimes be used synonymously "
"to \"constellation\". In the modern use it describes a figure which is not "
"part of the official canon. Sometimes an asterism is a part of a "
"constellation, e.g. the Big Dipper as part of Ursa Major, or Great Square as "
"part of Pegasus. Other asterisms span over several constellations, e.g. the "
"Summer Triangle or Winter Hexagon. Yet others are only visible in binoculars "
"or telescopes and are aptly named \"telescopic asterism\", e.g. the "
"Coathanger. They are often discussed in the observing columns of popular "
"astronomy magazines.\n"
"\n"
"### Ray Helpers\n"
"\n"
"Seasoned observers can find their way around the sky easily. One mnemonic "
"tool are associative chains of stars that span large distances. We show them "
"as \"ray helpers\". These are not standardized.\n"
"\n"
"### Proper names of stars\n"
"\n"
"Ptolemy's star catalogue had the layout of a table listing the description "
"of the star's position in the constellation's figure, the ecliptical "
"coordinates, and the magnitude e.g.: \"The star at the tip of the tail of "
"Ursa Minor\", \"Gem 0 1/6, +66\", \"Mag 3\".\n"
"\n"
"In most cases, the star names evolved by astronomer's systematical "
"abbreviations of these descriptions, e.g., a first astronomer abbreviated in "
"a text \"tip of the tail\", a next astronomer drew a map with less space and "
"wrote only \"tail\" next to the star and this name remained. Over centuries, "
"these descriptions were translated into Arabic and Latin, and in some cases "
"the translators or scribes made mistakes because of misreading or "
"misspelling of the Arabic words (e.g. the Arabic \"yad al gauza\", the hand "
"of the giant woman, was mangled to the common term \"Betelgeuse\").\n"
"\n"
"However, there are also a few original Greek words like the red star "
"\"Antares\", the counterpart of Ares (Mars), and even a few original "
"Babylonian terms like \"Shargaz\", the Sting, in Scorpius. Our modern, most "
"recent IAU star names [#45] are a renewed mixture, also with influences or "
"even politically wanted additions of star names from the non-Ptolemaic sky "
"cultures, e.g. the traditional Pingsing, a Chinese star name for a star in "
"Hydra (its meaning is only \"star\", a reminescence to his lonely position), "
"or newly adopted star names from Polynesian, Hawaiian, or Aboriginal "
"cultures for names of stars with exoplanets.\n"
"\n"
"The IAU is the only scientifically accepted authority to assign new names to "
"stars. Commercial exploits like \"star name registries\", who sell stars for "
"commemorative purposes or as gifts, only sell printed pieces of paper. These "
"names are not approved and never used by scientists."

"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"The modern Chinese use the constellations of the International Astronomical "
"Union. The traditional Chinese constellations have no specific boundaries "
"between them. They only represent the corresponding set of bright stars, and "
"do not have the role of dividing the celestial sphere into different areas, "
"so they are no longer applicable in astronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### Star names\n"
"\n"
"The Chinese now use traditional star names instead of Western star names. "
"More than 3,000 stars have traditional Chinese star names. When a foreign "
"astronomical book is translated into Chinese, the star names will also be "
"translated into traditional Chinese star names. There are some special stars "
"that use the names of Western stars, such as Proxima, Van Maanen's star, "
"which can usually only be seen with a telescope, but with special "
"astronomical significance.\n"

"The modern sky culture divides the celestial sphere into 88 areas of various "
"sizes called constellations, each with precise boundary, issued by the "
"International Astronomical Union in 1922. These constellations have become "
"the standard way to describe the sky, replacing similar sets in other sky "
"cultures exhaustively in daily usage.\n"
"\n"
"The constellations in use today are based mainly on ancient Greek "
"constellations depicted by Ptolemy in his book the Almagest during the 2nd "
"century CE. In the subsequent centuries, this book has been translated from "
"Greek into Arabic (6th to 9th century) and later to medieval Latin. In the "
"Arabic more than in the Latin tradition, the Ptolemaic figures were enriched "
"and transformed by native Arabic constellations and star names.\n"
"\n"
"In the 16-18th centuries, European astronomers suggested new constellations "
"to fill the gaps between northern constellations (e.g. the constellation of "
"\"the lynx\" for an area close to the Great Bear but with stars so faint "
"that you would need the eyes of a lynx to see them) and also created new "
"constellations in the southern part of the sky which had not been visible to "
"Ptolemy. These new constellations were usually named after new technical "
"inventions of the early modern period (e.g. a chemical furnace, a balloon, "
"an air pump) or exotic animals (e.g. a chamaeleon, a tucan, a paradise "
"bird). Among them several constellations were also named with political "
"consideration to honor certain kings or patrons.\n"
"\n"
"In the beginning of the 20th century, the IAU (International Astronomical "
"Union) aimed for a large clean-up: in 1922, it officially accepted the list "
"of 88 constellation names. In 1928 it also defined precise constellation "
"boundaries [#4] still in use today.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"These constellations are based mainly on the Ptolemaic tradition which had "
"been used in all three Abrahamitic religions and, thus, was common in the "
"Near East, in Europe and its colonies on all continents. However, between "
"the ancient Greek constellations there were gaps of areas with only faint "
"stars belonging to no constellation.[#5] In the Modern Epoch, several "
"astronomers suggested constellation figures for these gaps, among them "
"several political constellations to the honor of certain kings or patrons. "
"In the late 19th century, the astronomical research community aimed for a "
"huge clean-up to avoid ambiguities in assigning stars to constellations.\n"
"\n"
"In 1922, the IAU officially approved the list of 88 constellation names and "
"their official abbreviations with three letters. The only remaining "
"political constellation is Scutum, the shield of a Polish king but without "
"mentioning the political reference anymore. The Belgian priest E. Delporte "
"got the task to define constellation boundaries according to coordinates. In "
"1928, he finished the work, based on an atlas from Argentina [#6], and the "
"IAU accepted his delimitations [#4].\n"
"\n"
"These \"constellations\" are naked areas in the sky without any stick "
"figures or depictions [#1]. The borders simply follow the lines of right "
"ascension and declination from the epoch 1875.0. Precession causes a slowly "
"increasing deviation from the originally rectilinear grid. These "
"constellations became the standard way to describe the sky, replacing "
"similar sets in other sky cultures exhaustively in daily usage.\n"
"\n"
"#### Constellation Figures\n"
"\n"
"In star maps it is common to mark line \"patterns\" that represent the "
"shapes that give the name to the constellations. However, the IAU defines a "
"constellation by its boundary (indicated by sky coordinates) and not by its "
"pattern and the same constellation may have several variants in its "
"representation.\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture uses constellation figures were produced in collaboration "
"with \"Sky and Telescope\" magazine (Roger Sinnott and Rick Fienberg) and "
"published at IAU official website [#1]. Alan MacRobert's constellation "
"patterns, were influenced by those of H. A. Rey but in many cases were "
"adjusted to preserve earlier traditions.\n"
"\n"
"### Proper names of stars\n"
"\n"
"Ptolemy's star catalogue had the layout of a table listing the description "
"of the star's position in the constellation's figure, the ecliptical "
"coordinates, and the magnitude e.g.: \"The star at the tip of the tail of "
"Ursa Minor\", \"Gem 0 1/6, +66\", \"Mag 3\".\n"
"\n"
"In most cases, the star names evolved by astronomer's systematical "
"abbreviations of these descriptions, e.g., a first astronomer abbreviated in "
"a text \"tip of the tail\", a next astronomer drew a map with less space and "
"wrote only \"tail\" next to the star and this name remained. Over centuries, "
"these descriptions were translated into Arabic and Latin, and in some cases "
"the translators or scribes made mistakes because of misreading or "
"misspelling of the Arabic words (e.g. the Arabic \"yad al gauza\", the hand "
"of the giant woman, was mangled to the common term \"Betelgeuse\").\n"
"\n"
"However, there are also a few original Greek words like the red star "
"\"Antares\", the counterpart of Ares (Mars), and even a few original "
"Babylonian terms like \"Shargaz\", the Sting, in Scorpius. Our modern, most "
"recent IAU star names [#7] are a renewed mixture, also with influences or "
"even politically wanted additions of star names from the non-Ptolemaic sky "
"cultures, e.g. the traditional Pingsing, a Chinese star name for a star in "
"Hydra (its meaning is only \"star\", a reminescence to his lonely position), "
"or newly adopted star names from Polynesian, Hawaiian, or Aboriginal "
"cultures for names of stars with exoplanets.\n"
"\n"
"The IAU is the only scientifically accepted authority to assign new names to "
"stars. Commercial exploits like \"star name registries\", who sell stars for "
"commemorative purposes or as gifts, only sell printed pieces of paper. These "
"names are not approved and never used by scientists.\n"
"\n"
"### Proper names of deep-sky objects\n"
"\n"
"Uranometria 2000.0 is an atlas of the 2000.0 era starry sky prepared by the "
"Dutch artist Wil Tirion and published in 1987 by the American publishing "
"house Willmann-Bell, specializing in astronomical literature.\n"
"\n"
"The Atlas of Tirion, respected by astronomers for its accuracy and beauty, "
"is provided with detailed tables and various indexes. The second volume "
"contains three transparent overlays designed for precise measurements. "
"Uranometria 2000.0 contains more than 280,000 stars and more than 30,000 "
"deep-sky objects - in particular, all the objects of the Messier and NGC "
"catalogs.\n"
"\n"
"The second (corrected and most complete) three-volume edition of "
"\"Uranometria 2000.0\", was published in 2001 under the name \"Uranometria "
"2000.0 Deep Sky Atlas\" and contains 280035 stars of both hemispheres up to "

"spreads of A3 format. Particular attention in the atlas is paid to deep-sky "
"objects, there are more than 30 thousand of them in the second edition - "
"many times more than in any other paper atlas.\n"

"<img src=\"illustrations/Rey_cover.png\" width=\"150\" align=\"right\"/> H. "
"A. Rey (Hans Augusto Reyersbach) (1898-1977), an artist and author of "
"children's books of German descent but emigrated to the USA, published his "
"answer to this problem in 1952 with the book *The Stars - A New Way To See "
"Them*[#1][#2].\n"
"\n"
"### The Constellations\n"
"\n"
"In this book, which has become very popular especially in the US, Rey "
"connected the stars of every constellation \"in such a way that the "
"resulting shape makes sense.\" What surprised him was \"that nobody has done "
"it before. The basic idea is so simple.\"\n"
"\n"
"Rey's new stick figures make it indeed very simple to recognize the depicted "
"constellation figures. Rey's work does not include figurative artwork, "
"therefore this sky culture deliberately only comes with Rey's original stick "
"figures. The constellation names were also always given in English by Rey. "
"If you switch to \"Native\" name display mode, you may see exactly the "
"spelling used in his book. Also the stars named here are limited to those "
"included in the book.\n"
"\n"
"### Rey's Figures and the Classic Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Rey's constellations adhere to the tradition of the Western sky culture and "
"describes the 88 officially acknowledged constellations, with addition of "
"asterisms of the two Dippers and the \"Great Square\" (of Pegasus). However, "
"at several points Rey's figures deviate from the canonical figures described "
"since Ptolemy's Almagest (2nd century AD), where also positions of the stars "
"in their constellations had been described in their names. For example,\n"
"\n"

"### 星座\n"

"### Figures in the sky\n"
"\n"
"People have probably always looked up to the stars. Some of them might "
"wonder, what those little dots of light meant, up there. In their thoughts "
"they connected the stars to form images and thus created their very own "
"constellations.\n"
"\n"
"Each culture had different ideas about what was going on in the night sky. "
"And so each culture painted different figures in the sky. In the western "
"world, a sky culture emerged that, along with other influences, was strongly "
"influenced by Greek mythology. This western sky culture established itself "
"as the standard in modern astronomy."

"### Division of the sky\n"
"\n"
"In 1922 the International Astronomical Union began to define this standard "
"more precisely. 88 constellations were selected that covered the entire sky. "
"The names and the boundaries of the 88 constellations were made binding, but "
"not the historically created shapes of the constellations themselves.\n"
"\n"
"### From image to constellation\n"
"\n"
"Greek mythology is rich in stories about gods and heroes. These stories have "
"not been forgotten until today, among other things through the works of "
"Hesiod and Homer. Atlases were created that showed the starry sky, "
"illustrated with figures from Greek mythology. The stars in these figures "
"were connected by lines, creating constellations. It was clear what these "
"constellations were supposed to represent. But if you looked at the lines "
"alone without the corresponding figures, the connection to the constellation "
"was often no longer immediately understandable\n"
"\n"
"### The stars, a new way to see them\n"
"\n"
"The children's book author H. A. Rey recognized this dilemma. He wondered "
"why it had never occurred to anyone to draw the constellations so, that "
"their shape made sense. He connected stars with lines and thus painted his "
"own constellations. These constellations were intuitively recognizable, "
"because the constellation lines themselves painted the images. H. A. Rey "
"published his work under the title \"The Stars. A New Way To See Them\".\n"
"\n"
"### The sky culture sternenkarten.com\n"
"\n"
"The sky culture sternenkarten.com is based on the idea of H. A. Rey to paint "
"constellations in such a way, that they can be recognized intuitively. Some "
"of the constellations, it contains, are more or less similar to those of H. "
"A. Rey, others are based on the western standard sky culture. And still "
"others have been completely redesigned.\n"
"\n"
"As far as possible, the following points have been implemented\n"
"\n"
" - Clear simple shapes\n"
" - Intuitive recognizability\n"
" - Recognizing is more important than the inclusion of many stars\n"
" - Fainter stars are not considered because of the light pollution in the "
"modern world\n"
" - Triangles are easy to spot. That is why the characters wear triangular "
"hats\n"
"\n"
"The following special features were built into the constellation culture:\n"
"\n"
" - The constellation Lynx uses a star from the constellation Great Bear\n"
" - The constellation Snake is not divided into two parts. A complete snake "
"is drawn\n"
" - The star Alpheratz belongs to both the constellation Pegasus and the "
"constellation Andromeda\n"

"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
" Generally, stars represent animals turning around the North Star which is "
"symbolized by the golden stick (*Altan Hadaas*). Almost all Mongolian "
"asterisms are similar to those that we know. However some have other names "
"like *Num Sum* (The Bow and the Arrow) for the constellation Swan, or "
"*Doloon Burkhan* for the seven stars of the Big Dipper. The summer triangle "
"made up of Vega, Deneb and Altair stars refers to three stags (*Gurvan Maral "
"Od* in Mongolian). And Cassiopeia represents, in the Mongolian imagination, "
"the Five Stars Woman (*Hun Tavan Od*).\n"
"\n"
"### Planets and Stars\n"
"\n"
" Originally, Tibeto-Mongolian astrology calculates the positions of each of "
"the planets visible with the naked eye. Because planets beyond Saturn are "
"not visible without telescope (the instrument which appeared long time after "
"the creation of their astrology), the Mongolians have attributed one of the "
"five planets for each day of the week, completing with the Sun (*Nar*) for "
"Sunday and the Moon (*Sar*) for Monday. The names of the Solar System's "
"planets and Pluto have some peculiarities in Mongolian. Mercury is named "
"*Bud* (associated with Wednesday), Venus, *Sugar* (associated with Friday), "
"the Earth, *Delkhii*, Mars, *Angarag* (associated with Tuesday), Jupiter, "
"*Barhasbadi* (associated with Thursday), Saturn, *Sanchir* (associated with "
"Saturday), Uranus, *Tengeriin-van*, Neptune, *Dalai-van* and at last Pluto, "
"*Dalkhii-van*. We can see that the three last, invisible to the naked eye "
"and discovered long time after the others, have the characteristic to have "
"the particle *-van* at the end of the name, indicating the princely status "
"in Mongolian. Earth and Pluto are named similarly, except that this last one "
"has this particle. It is possible to translate from Mongolian Pluto like "
"\"The princely ground\" (ground and not Earth because it means here the "
"surface on which we walk, not the Earth. Uranus, *Tengeriin-van*, could be "
"translated as \"princely sky\", and Neptune, *Dalai-van*, as the \"princely "
"ocean\". Nevertheless, this particle has no real equivalent in English, and "
"translations above are presented to give an idea of the planets name's "
"meaning. However, the names of the celestial bodies specified here come from "
"Sanskrit (language spoken in India) and are largely used in the current "
"language in Mongolia but in an unofficial way.\n"
"\n"
" It is also very interesting to see the tight link between terms designating "
"other celestial bodies and their beliefs: indeed, *Tengeriin Zadas* appoints "
"the Milky Way. We could literally translate this as the \"Sky Line"
"\" (*Tengeriin* for the sky, which also means the god of the sky, and "
"*Zadas* for the line). Well known in Mongolian star lore concerns Alcor, the "
"star located above Mizar in the Big Bear. It symbolises the recover and "
"protection star. It was placed here by *Tengeriin* (god of heaven) to "
"protect Mizar. To become an archer for Genghis Khan (13th century), it "
"seemed that one had to be able to discern these two stars with the naked "
"eye.\n"
"\n"
" From a historic point of view, this excellent knowledge of the sky goes "
"back to *Ulug Beg* (AD1394-1449; *Taraghay* by his real name), astronomer, "
"mathematician and viceroy in Samarkand whose empire spread as far as Central "
"Asia. Turning away from his royal obligations, he examined celestial bodies "
"and astronomical questions of his time. He is the first to extremely "
"precisely measure Saturn's revolution period (*Sanchir*) with a sextant of "
"40 meters radius.\n"
"\n"
"### Myths and Legends\n"
"\n"
"### The Great Bear\n"
"\n"
" Mongolians are particularly attached to the Great Bear. This constellation "
"is limited for them to the seven Dipper stars making the bear's tail and "
"body, but the legend concerning it is probably the most famous in Mongolia.\n"
"\n"
"> Once upon a time, there were eight orphan brothers gifted with outstanding "
"capabilities living within a kingdom. The king and the queen lived within it "
"peacefully. One day, a monster came and kidnapped the queen. The king asked "
"the eight brothers to bring her back and said: \"If one of you succeeds to "
"rescue my beloved, I will give to him a golden arrow\". The orphans went "
"together to assist their queen. They searched the monster during two days "
"and three nights, when in the middle of the third night, they found and "
"killed the monster. They brought back the queen in the castle.\n"
">\n"
"> The king did not cut out the arrow in eight parts, he decided to threw it "
"in the sky. The first to catch it could keep it. The younger brother "
"succeeded the test and changed immediately into the North Star (Polar Star). "
"The seven others changed into the seven gods, the seven Buddhas visiting "
"their younger brother every night. The name *Doloon burkhan* (the Seven "
"Buddhas) come from this legend to appoint the Great Bear and the Golden "
"Stick, *Altan Hadaas*, the Polar Star.\n"
"\n"
" A tradition, particularly delightful, concerns the link between Mongolian "
"people and the Great Bear as one star of this constellation is attributed to "
"each of them. It depends on their birth year in the Chinese calendar. "
"Chinese and Mongolian calendars have some similarities (the Mongolian "
"calendar is a lunar calendar). Each year is symbolized by an animal, itself "
"associated to a star of the constellation Great Bear. The first, Dubhe, "
"corresponds to the rat's year, the second, Merak, corresponds to the ox and "
"so on until the end of the Great Bear's tail where Alkaid symbolizes the "
"year of the horse. Then we come back to the first, the sheep year and we "
"repeat the same way until the twelfth and latest year of the Chinese "
"calendar, the one of the pig. Therefore, the two stars at the end of the "
"tail are assigned one time only.\n"
"\n"
"[Note by G. Zotti: This is a variant of the old Seven Buddha Sutra described "
"by *Elverskog*. There however, the association of the stars goes in an up-"
"and-down movement, i.e., Dubhe/Rat, Merak/Ox, ... Mizar/Snake, Alkaid/Horse, "
"Mizar/Goat, ... Merak/Pig.]\n"
" <img src=\"illustrations/doloon_burkhan.png\" width=\"550\">\n"
"\n"
"### Shooting stars\n"
"\n"
" Shooting stars have also a specific meaning: they are personified through "
"their beliefs. When they see these shooting stars they imagine that it is a "
"star which falls from the sky and which symbolizes somebody who just died. "
"Whereas occidental people make a wish, Mongolians say: \"Phew, it is not me!"
"\"\n"
"\n"
"### Neglected Legends\n"
"\n"
" Three legends just as rich in meaning concern the Sun, eclipses and *Hun "
"Tavan Od* (Cassiopeia). However, they are nowadays neglected and almost "
"forgotten by most Mongolians:\n"
"\n"
"#### Sun\n"
"\n"
"> At the origin of the world, there was only one man and vast particularly "
"dry meadows, burned by the seven suns which lit the world. This man, a very "
"good archer, made the promise to the gods that he pierced all these suns "
"without missing a target even once. If he should fail, he would cut himself "
"all the fingers one by one and leave to live in a hole like a marmot "
"(groundhog) to ward off the curse that would weigh on him. He took his bow, "
"pulled a first arrow and hit his target. A second, a third until the sixth "
"which destroyed the suns. He finished by pulling his seventh arrow towards "
"the last sun, when a swallow flew off and passed through its direction. The "
"bird was hit. The man had not reach his goal, so he left towards exile in a "
"hole, cut his fingers and turned into a marmot. The swallow had just saved "
"our Sun, otherwise all life would have disappeared from the world's "
"surface.\n"
"\n"
" We have to see here a parallel with the number seven, important in the "
"Mongolian culture like all odd numbers. They bring luck in the buddhist "
"religion.\n"
"\n"
"#### Eclipses\n"
"\n"
"> At that time lived a scary monster named *Raah* which frightened the "
"entire world. He devoured all who were in its way. The god *Orchiwaani* "
"owned a magic spring: whoever drank from it became immortal. One day, *Raah* "
"stole the spring and drunk. The Moon and the Sun caught the monster in the "
"act and reported to *Orchiwaani*. Seething with rage to hear about this "
"piece of news he went to fight the monster. He cut its head many times but "
"it grew again immediately because *Raah* had become immortal. He thought "
"then to cut its tail in order to allow all that it ate to leave again "
"directly. Just as *Orchiwaani* would seize the monster to finish it off, it "
"escaped and disappeared between the Moon and the Sun. Then *Orchiwaani* "
"asked the Moon, who recaptured *Raah* and cut its rump and its tail. In "
"revenge, the monster comes back sometimes to eat the Moon or the Sun which "
"exit immediately, giving rise to moon and solar eclipses.\n"
"\n"
"When there is an eclipse, Mongolians know that it means that *Raah* devours "
"the Moon or the Sun and they make a lot of noise so that the monster "
"liberates the eclipsed star. In the 13th century, Guillaume de Rubruck "
"wrote:\n"
"\n"
"> \"Some [Mongolian people] have knowledge in astronomy and predict them [to "
"other Mongolian people] the Lunar and Solar eclipses and, when it is about "
"to produce one, everybody stocks up on food because they do not pass the "
"door of their habitation. And while the eclipse happened, they play the drum "
"and instruments and do big noise and clamors. When the eclipse is finished, "
"they devote themselves to beverage and festivity and do big party.\"\n"
"\n"
"(Source: [#1])\n"
"\n"
"Eclipse travelers in 2008 still witnessed drivers and cooks hiding in their "
"tents and making noise with the pots. It seemed authentic, not a show for "
"the tourists. Also note the similarity of *Raah* with Indian *Rahu*.\n"
"\n"
"#### Cassiopeia (*Hun Tavan Od*)\n"
"\n"
"Cassiopeia (*Hun Tavan Od*) symbolises unity, brotherhood, solidarity for "
"the Mongolians. The constellation's five stars represent unity of the five "
"children of Genghis Khan's wife, Oulin.\n"
"\n"
"> Them did not get well along with each other and squabbled all the time. "
"Their mother decided to strongly tie five ropes, and each one should try to "
"untie a knot. If they succeeded, it meant that they didn't remain united "
"with other, and that the brotherhood didn't gather in hard times. "
"Conversely, if the knots withstood the test, the five brothers would remain "
"united and close for the rest of their lives and would be victorious at the "
"time of wars.\n"
"\n"
"### Other Beliefs Linked to the Sky\n"
"\n"
"According to a Mongolian legend, a woman devoting herself to count one "
"hundred stars in the sky will dream about her future husband.\n"
"\n"
" Sometimes, Mongolians honor the Great Bear (*Doloon Burkhan*) by throwing "
"milk in its direction. Milk, of white color, symbolizes purity in Mongolia. "
"They pray so that something may be fulfilled, but for several persons, not "
"for just one person, because this would bring bad luck. Milk can be replaced "
"by vodka which, even if it is colorless, symbolizes the dark color and the "
"strength for Mongolians. By doing this, it avoids bad luck, quarrels, fear "
"and fends off evil spirits.\n"
"\n"
"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
" The constellations are inspired by occidental ones, but the Mongolian "
"cosmogony, briefly exposed here, highlights a notable identity of beliefs "
"which are associated with it. Mongolian culture and knowledge transmission "
"is essentially verbal, and so few written traces exist about these subjects. "
"It is therefore particularly hard to relate their cosmogony with high "
"fidelity and precision. In order to preserve knowledge about this cosmogony, "
"every observation, suggestions or collaboration are welcome!\n"

"### 星座\n"
"\n"
"一般來說，恒星是圍繞著以金標樁 (*Altan Hadaas*)為代表的北極恒星旋轉的動物。幾"
"乎所有的蒙古星座都與我們所知道的相似。 然而，有一些還有其他名字，比如天鵝座的"
"是*Num Sum*（弓和箭），或者北斗七星*Doloon Burkhan* （七佛）。由織女一，河鼓"
"二，天津四組成的夏季大三角指的是三雄鹿（蒙古語中的*Gurvan Maral Od*）。 在蒙"
"古人的想像中，仙后座代表了五星之母（*Hun Tavan Od* ）。\n"
"\n"
"### 行星和恒星\n"
"\n"
" 最初，藏蒙占星術用肉眼計算出每個行星的位置。因為沒有望遠鏡（儀器在占星術創建"
"後出現很長時間）就不能看到土星以外的行星，蒙古人將五大行星對應星期二到星期流"
"六加上星期天的太陽（ *Nar*）和星期一的和月亮（*Sar*）。太陽系的行星和冥王星的"
"名字在蒙古語中有一些特點。水星被命名為*Bud*（與星期三相關），金星-*Sugar*（與"
"星期五相關），地球- *Delkhii*，火星- *Angarag* （與週二相關），木星-"
"*Barhasbadi*（與週四相關），土星- *Sanchir*（與星期六相關），天王星-"
"*Tengeriin-van*，海王星-*Dalai-van*，最後是冥王星-*Dalkhii-van*。最後三個行星"
"肉眼看不見，並在其它行星發現之後很長時間才發現，具有在名稱末尾有尾碼 *-van* "
"的特徵，表示蒙古族的王族。地球和冥王星的命名相似，只不過冥王星有這個尾碼。當"
"地的天體名稱主要來自梵語（在印度使用的語言）。\n"
"\n"
"蒙古的天文描述與其信仰之間的緊密聯繫也非常有趣：事實上，*Tengeriin Zadas*意思"
"是銀河系。我們可以把它翻譯為“天空線”（ *Tengeriin*為天空，這也意味著天空之"
"神，*Zadas*為線）。眾所周知的蒙古恒星傳說是關於輔星的，這顆星位於開陽星上方。"
"它是象徵恢復和守護的恒星。為了守護開陽星，它被*Tengeriin*（天堂之神）放置在這"
"裡。要成為成吉思汗（13世紀）的弓箭手，似乎必須能夠用肉眼辨別出這兩顆恒星。\n"
"\n"
" 從歷史的角度來看，這種天空的認識可以追溯到*兀魯伯*（1394-1449; *，帖木爾之"
"孫，真名穆罕默德·塔拉蓋*），天文學家，數學家和撒馬爾罕的總督。他背棄了他的王"
"室義務，研究了他那個時代的天體和天文問題。他是第一個用半徑40米的六分儀非常準"
"確地測量土星的（*Sanchir*）的人。\n"
"\n"
"### 神話\n"
"\n"
"### 北斗\n"
"\n"
" 蒙古人特別喜歡北斗七星，有關它的傳說可能是蒙古最著名的。\n"
"\n"
"> 曾經，有八個孤兒兄弟擁有出色的能力，生活在一個王國裡。國王和王后和平地生活"
"在其中。有一天，一個怪物來了並綁架了女王。國王讓八兄弟把她帶回來說：“如果你們"
"其中一人成功拯救了我心愛的人，我會給他一個金色的箭頭”。孤兒們一起去幫助他們的"
"女王。他們在兩天三夜中搜尋了怪物，當時在第三天中旬，他們發現並殺死了怪物。他"
"們把女王帶回了城堡。\n"
">\n"
"> 國王沒有將箭頭分成八部分，他決定把它扔在天空中。第一個抓住它可以保留它。弟"
"弟接受了測試並立即成為北極星。其他七個人變成了七個佛，七個佛每晚都會拜訪他們"
"的弟弟。星座 *Doloon burkhan* （七佛）和 *Altan Hadaas*（金標樁）來自這個傳"
"說。\n"
"\n"
"一個特別有意思的傳統是蒙古人和北斗七星之間的聯繫，因為他們被授予了七星中的一"
"個。 這種聯繫取決於中國曆法中的出生年份。中國和蒙古的曆法有相似之處（蒙古曆基"
"於農曆）。 每年都有一隻動物的象徵，它本身與星座中的一顆星相關聯。第一個，天樞"
"是鼠年，第二個，天璿，是牛年，一直到北斗七星尾巴的末端，搖光是馬年。 然後我們"
"回到天樞，羊年，重複一次，直到中國曆法的豬年。結果，星座尾部的兩顆恒星只被分"
"配一次。\n"
" <img src=\"illustrations/doloon_burkhan.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"Doloon "
"Burkhana\">\n"
"\n"
"### 流星\n"
"\n"
"流星也有特殊的含義：它們是通過他們的信仰來人格化的。當他們看到這些流星時，他"
"們會想像它是一顆從天而降的星星，象徵著剛剛死去的人。 雖然西方人許願，蒙古人"
"說：“哎呀，不是我！”\n"
"\n"
"### 被忽略的傳說\n"
"\n"
"三個傳說同樣豐富的意義，涉及太陽，日月食和 *Hun Tavan Od* （五星之母）。然"
"而，現在它們被大多數蒙古人忽視並幾乎被遺忘：\n"
"\n"
"#### 太陽\n"
"\n"
"> 在世界創始不久，大地被七個太陽所炙烤。有一個非常優秀的弓箭手，向眾神承諾，"
"他會射掉所有的太陽。如果他失敗了，他會一個接一個地切斷自己的所有手指，變成土"
"撥鼠留在洞中，以抵禦對他構成壓力的詛咒。他拿起弓，拉了第一支箭，擊中了他的目"
"標。第二，第三，直到第六，摧毀了太陽。他完成了將第七支箭拉向最後的太陽，一隻"
"燕子剛好飛過，攔截了射出的箭。男人沒有達到他的目標，所以他走向一個洞，流下手"
"指，變成了土撥鼠。燕子剛剛救了我們的太陽，否則一切生命都會從世界的表面消"
"失。\n"
"\n"
"#### 日月食\n"
"\n"
"> 一種叫做*Raah*的可怕怪物，嚇到了整個世界。他吞噬了所有阻礙他的人。神"
"*Orchiwaani*有一種神奇的酒。喝了它的人會永生。有一天，*Raah*偷走了酒並喝了"
"它。月亮和太陽抓住了怪物並向 *Orchiwaani*報告。他非常生氣地聽了消息，去和怪物"
"作戰。他幾次切斷了怪物的頭，但因為*Raah*變成永生而自動長出來。他最後切斷了怪"
"物的臀部和尾巴。為了復仇，怪物有時會回來吃月亮或太陽，這就是月食和日食。\n"
"\n"
"當有日食或者月食時，蒙古人知道這意味著*Raah*吞噬月亮或太陽，他們會發出很多噪"
"音，以便怪物釋放出太陽和月亮。在13世紀，Guillaume de Rubruck寫道：\n"
"\n"
"> \"一些[蒙古人]對天文學有所瞭解，並（對其他蒙古人）預測月食和日食。日食發生"
"時，他們演奏鼓和樂器，做大聲吵鬧。日食結束後，他們在喝酒放縱，並舉辦大型聚"
"會。\"\n"
"\n"
"(來源: [#1])\n"
" <p>2008年的日食旅行者仍然目睹了司機和廚師躲在帳篷裡並用鍋子製造噪音。這似乎"
"是真實的，而不是遊客的表演。 還要注意<em> Raah </ em>與印度的 *Rahu*的相似之"
"處。</p>\n"
"\n"
"#### 五星之母\n"
"\n"
"*Hun Tavan Od*（五星之母），也就是仙后座的五顆亮星，象徵著蒙古人的團結，兄弟"
"情誼和團結。星座的五顆星代表成吉思汗的妻子Oulin的五個孩子。\n"
"\n"
"### 與天空相關的其他信仰\n"
"\n"
"根據蒙古傳說，有一個致力於在天空中數清楚一百顆星星的女人夢想著她未來的丈"
"夫。\n"
"\n"
"有時，蒙古人通過向其方向倒牛奶來紀念七佛（*Doloon Burkhan*） 。白色牛奶象徵著"
"蒙古的純潔。他們祈禱，以便可以實現某些事情，但對於一些人而言，這會帶來厄運。"
"牛奶可以用伏特加代替，伏特加雖然是無色的，但卻象徵著蒙古人的黑色。 通過這樣"
"做，它可以避免不幸，爭吵，恐懼，並防止邪惡的心理。\n"
"\n"
"### 結論\n"
"\n"
"這些星座的確受到了西方人的啟發，在這裡簡要介紹的蒙古宇宙觀強調了與之相關的信"
"仰的顯著特徵。 蒙古文化和知識傳播本質上是口頭的，關於這些主題的書面記錄很少。"
"因此，特別難以將其宇宙觀與高保真度和高精度聯繫起來。 為了保留關於這個宇宙觀的"
"知識，歡迎任何評論，建議或合作！\n"

"The Northern Andes have a complex laboratory that teaches us about the "
"different sciences that humanity has contemplated in its history; starting "
"from observation to the various elements that surround us, with the need to "
"ensure our survival as a species and lineage, the human being learned to "
"understand the signals that the cosmos, plants, animals, the climate and "
"other elements emit constantly. Then the wise learned to warn about the "
"changes that affect living beings."
msgstr ""

#. Northern Andes sky culture description section in markdown format
msgid ""
"In order to replicate the ancestral measurements in the Andean "
"observatories, we propose the use of a wide-mouth container; in the open we "
"will place it and level properly. In order to create a star mirror we will "
"fill it with water, in this reflection of the sky, the Andean sage can "
"admire and record the movements of the sun, the moon, planets or the stars.\n"
"\n"
"The Stellarium simulator allows us to recreate these \"cosmic mirrors\" and "
"analyze the specific stellar dynamics that are seen in the Northern Andes as "
"well as the millenarian wise men in their patient observation through the "
"ages. These beings have registered the cosmic movements in the current "
"prehispanic heritage of the Andean peoples and produced graphic "
"configurations, which after much joint work by several researchers in "
"several generations at the beginning of the 21st century have been partially "
"decoded.\n"
"\n"
"Here we tell what we found in the equatorial skies:\n"
"\n"
"### The Sun (Punchao o Wilca)\n"
"\n"
"When we find ourselves in the center of the planet, the apparent movement "
"that the sun makes through our annual journey around it is equidistant and "
"proportional. At the equinoxes the sun will cross the center of the sky, on "
"the solstice of June it will travel its southernmost road (it will go north) "
"and on the solstice of December the northernmost path will be traveled (more "
"to the south). These natural phenomena are the marks of the four main "
"festivals that celebrate a specific part of the agricultural calendar "
"because they are the points of inflection between the climatic seasons.\n"
"\n"
"According to the colonial chronicler Juan de Betanzos \"the Indians knew the "
"leap years\"; thanks to the research of Gustavo Guayasamín, a cyclic "
"movement is identified in a four-year interval in the sun; to observe it, we "
"suggest placing ourselves at the March equinox (approximately the March "
"equinoxes are the 21st day in the Gregorian calendar), at the solar daytime "
"(12:20 in the civil time for the year 2018). We can then move forward in "
"time thanks to the \"Date / Time Window\" from year to year and we will "
"notice that the sun moves, returning to the point where the observation "
"begins in periods of four years, for example: It starts in 2016, moves to "
"the left of the spectator in 2017, continues moving to the left in 2018, "
"also moves in 2019 and in 2020 returns to its initial position; then start "
"the cycle again.\n"
"\n"
"### Clear Constellations, Asterisms and Guidelines in the Andes.\n"
"\n"
"We consider that by means of \"stellar mirrors\" the sages could register "
"the stellar traffic. Through this observation they noticed that during the "
"nightfalls of each equinox and solstice, specific stars appear in the sky, "
"as if they were marking the climatic changes to which we are exposed, so "
"these cosmic signals were recorded in the Andean prehispanic patrimony "
"giving rise to the Andean geometrical forms.\n"
"\n"
"#### March Equinox\n"
"\n"
"**\"Antonio Quinatoa\" Cross:** At dusk the first stars to appear are: "
"Sirius - Procyon - Rigel - Betelgeuse, who form the cross named \"Antonio "
"Quinatoa\". It is the constellation that governs the masculine cycle.\n"
"\n"
"#### September Equinox\n"
"\n"
"**Molestina Triangle:** The first stars to appear are: Altair - Vega - "
"Antares who make up the triangle named \"Molestina\"\n"
"\n"
"**Constellation Daniela Alejandra Ayala:** Thanks to the hard work in the "
"registration of the designs, we have identified the clear constellation "
"named \"Daniela Alejandra Ayala\", cosmic set that accompanies the image of "
"the \"Mono Andino\", will appear in the center of the sky at nightfall of "
"the female equinox.\n"
"\n"
"#### June Solstice\n"
"\n"
"**South Cross:** The most outstanding stars in the evening of the Summer "
"Solstice for the Northern Hemisphere are: Acrux, Mimosa, δ Crucis, ζ Crucis, "
"λ Crucis and μ Crucis who form the \"Southern Cross\".\n"
"\n"
"#### December Solstice\n"
"\n"
"**The “Jorge Trujillo” Arrow:** The most outstanding stars in the evening of "
"the winter solstice for the southern hemisphere are Caph - Shedar - Navi - κ "
"Cas, they are part of the western constellation of Cassiopeia, the resulting "
"form evokes the shape of an arrow that at the end of the December solstice "
"It is in an East - West direction.\n"
"\n"
"The asterisms that we include are the first stars to appear at the end of "
"each equinox or solstice. Like the constellations, these basic forms "
"(diamond, square, triangle and arrow), mark the beginning or end of a cycle, "
"apparently human beings discovered and recorded them before the forms in the "
"dark constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### The Sacred Beings in the Cosmos. The Dark Constellations.\n"
"\n"
"#### The Milky Way\n"
"\n"
"Our planet belongs to the galaxy of the Milky Way, whose shape is that of a "
"large disk with two bulging arms; this form and the rotation of the earth "
"means that at the evenings of the equinoxes and solstices we can appreciate "
"a specific part of it, thus becoming a signal that the ancestors appreciated "
"to measure the times. Called in the Andes as the \"Muyun\" for many peoples, "
"it represents a gigantic life-giving serpent.\n"
"\n"
"Contrary to the West, the constellations are not made up of bright points or "
"stars; the astral beings are housed in the \"dark spots\" existing in the "
"brilliance of the Milky Way, so at each of the turning points in our annual "
"path around the sun (Solstices and Equinoxes), we will find a guiding "
"constellation in each \"visible end\" of the galaxy. As with lunar or solar "
"movements, the movements of the constellations in the Northern Andes marked "
"the beginning or end of specific eras, agricultural, civil, reproductive or "
"festive. They determined the fate of beings, receiving respect and "
"veneration for those who came for their wisdom; thus developing a religious "
"thought similar to that of the sun or the moon throughout the continent.\n"
"\n"
"Here we describe the constellations decoded to date:\n"
"\n"

"and pre-Christian elements where constellations are associated with "
"cosmogonical and theogonical myths, so that the sky is seen more like a "

msgid ""
"### Sources\n"
"\n"
"Stellarium's Sami sky culture is based on the work of Bo Lundmark[#3], who "
"based much of his work on the writings of the Sami artist and author Johan "
"Turi.\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture is a conglomeration of at least three slightly different "
"cultures from the people of the South-Sami, North-Sami and Russian Sami. "
"Each of these groups have slightly different languages and as such there may "
"be small differences with some references.\n"
"\n"
"Sami constellations can be observed on Sami artifacts connected to the old "
"religion, suggesting that the night sky played an important cultural role "
"for Sami peoples in years gone by.\n"
"\n"
"The Sami sky culture has a lot in common with other arctic and sub-arctic "
"cultures in Eurasia. One unfortunate similarity is that much of the culture "
"was lost before it was recorded properly.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations and Stars\n"
"\n"
"The Sami constellations are probably very old but were recorded in writing "
"during the 19th century. In is unclear if the written record is complete. "
"The constellations and stars included here are all connected to the dominant "
"constellation, *Sarva* &mdash; the elk. Sarva is the Sami name for elk, an "
"alternative name is *Sarvvis* &mdash; Bull elk. The origin of this "
"constellation probably dates back to the old hunter culture before reindeer "
"were domesticated.\n"
"\n"
"*Sarva* consists of the Western constellations Cassiopeia, Perseus and parts "
"of Auriga. Constellations and stars surrounding Sarva represent hunters of "
"the elk. *Favdna* (also transcribed as *Favtna*) is the star Arcturus, and "
"represents the Hunter who aims at the elk with his bow and arrow (*Fauna "
"davgge* &mdash; the Big Dipper). Favdna must aim well, for if he hits the "
"Sky Support *Boahjenaste* (the star Polaris), legend has it that the world "
"will come to an end.\n"
"\n"
"Favdna has a number of helpers: *Galla* (Procyon<sup>[1](#note1)</sup>) and "
"his sons *Gallabarneck* (Orion's belt), the \"Ski Runners\", *Cuoigahægjek* "
"(Castor and Pollux) and \"The Runner\" (Vega). The Pleiades are called "
"*Rougot* (dog pack) or *Miese-cora* (calfpack).\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is called *Lodde-raiddaras* (lit. bird path) or *Jakke-mærka* "
"(lit. year mark). The name used depends on the season. In the sky chart of "
"Johan Turi, one can observe a star *Guovso-naste*, morning star, that can be "
"identified as Venus, but this is not certain as it can also be identified as "
"Altair, a star showing the morning is approaching (similar to Arcturus in "
"the Norse skyculture).\n"
"\n"
"The Sami sky culture does not have a large number of constellations. This is "
"thought to be mainly because of the high Northerly latitude of the Sami "
"people's range. Two factors contribute to this: that the Southern sky stays "
"below the horizon to a large extent, and that the Aurora Borealis is "
"frequently bright enough to obscure many stars.\n"
"\n"
"### Notes\n"
"\n"
" 1. <a name=\"note1\"/>The exact star which represents *Galla* is uncertain. "
"it is probably Procyon, Rigel or Sirius - Procyon was chosen as Galla for "
"this sky culture since Sirius is very hard to spot from the latitude where "
"the Sami live."

"There have been six different Comca'ac groups (Comca'ac means \"people\"):\n"
"\n"
" - the Xica hacataj quitoj, who eat meat of sharks, inhabited San Esteban "
"Island (Isla Turón);\n"
" - the Xnamotat, who lived in the south, inhabit San Carlos, Guaymas and "
"Tastiota;\n"
" - the Cail hitic 'tamoc, the men from the valley, inhabited the region "
"between Tastiota and Bahía Kino;\n"
" - the Heno comca'ac, who live in the mountains, inhabited the centre of "
"Tiburón Island;\n"
" - the Tepocaj, the fishermen, who inhabited the region between Puerto "
"Libertad and Puerto Peñasco; and,\n"
" - the Tosni hox hanoquipilc, who fed themselves on sea birds (ducks and "
"pelicans), inhabited Island San Lorenzo.\n"
"\n"
" <img src=\"illustrations/abuela.png\" width=\"250\" align=\"left\" /"
">Nowadays, the Seri people live at Punta Chueca and Desemboque, located in "
"the coast of the northwestern state of Sonora, Mexico. According with the "
"fishing cycles, Comca'ac occupy several fishing camps at the litoral "
"distributed along a 100 km territory. The whole area assigned to them "
"reaches the 210 thousand hectares which corresponds to a region in the "
"continent and the Tiburón Island in the California gulf.\n"
"\n"
"The Seri language (coiiqui'itom) forms part of the seriyumana family which "
"means that, on one hand, its most recent relation can be given by the yumano "
"coming from the north of the Californian peninsula, and, on the other hand, "
"this language totally contrasts with the languages of its neighbouring "
"nations who talk uto-aztec ones like pima, p&#225;pago, yaqui and mayo; all "
"of them fila with a much more recent origin.\n"
"\n"
"The description of the Comca'ac (Seri) Constellations presented here comes "
"from the book \"Bajo el cielo Comca'ac: Astronomía entre el mar y el desierto"
"\", written by Arturo Morales Blanco, in which it is possible to identify "
"the relations between sky, sea and desert, as they are recovered by oral "
"tradition and family memories.\n"
"\n"
"This knowledge has arrived to us by oral transmission from generation to "
"generation through time and shows how the events from the sea like the "
"appearance of crabs or the abundance of Totoaba (a large fish, now in "
"danger), comes along with the presence of sets of stars in the sky. Comca'ac "
"people has named them Zaamth or Zix cam caoc'la, respectively; also, the "
"coincidence of Pitahayas (cactus fruits) in the cactus with the appearance "
"of constellation Hácosa (Corta-pitahayas) in the sky is very suggestive."

"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"All this knowledge of Comca'ac people comes from prehispanic epoch, and it "
"has prevailed through centuries, thanks to oral tradition and the strength "
"of the community to colonization, at first, and his opposition to "
"evangelization, later on. Still today, it is possible to hear the stories "
"and legends behind the naming of constellations and the events on the sea "
"and on the desert. With the recovery of these legends, by exercise of memory "
"and lively events with his ancestors, Arturo Morales Blanco gave us a legacy "
"that must be conserved for future generations: children, young people who "
"will keep in their own language how and what to look for in the sky."

"The Men Tsee Khang emblem shows 27 stick figures for the Lunar mansions "
"arranged in a circle around the central figure. The same figures are also "
"laid out in cement with bright stones connected by black lines in the "

"political borders of three countries converge: Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. "
"This is the reason why the Tikuna recognize themselves as a differentiated "

"Tikuna territory encompasses a region 600 kilometers long, running west to "
"east from the Chimbote region in Peru—along the emptiness of the Amazonas-"
"Solimões valley, in the so-called Trapézio Amazônico (Colombian Amazonian "
"Trapezoid)—to the Barreira da Missão region, in the municipality of Tefé, in "
"the Brazilian state of Amazonas (See The Ticuna Atlas, Figure I).\n"

"The agencies and researchers that deal with them estimate that more than "
"53,544 (Siasi/Sesai, 2014) Tikunas live in Brazil (FUNASA, 2009), 8.000 in "
"Colombia (Goulard, 2010), and 6.982 in Peru (INEL, 2007)<cite id=\"cit2a"
"\">[**<sup>2</sup>**](#cit2)</cite>. Together, they constitute the largest "
"Amazonian indigenous population. Aside from their own Tikuna language, they "
"also speak Spanish and Portuguese, depending on whether they live in "
"Colombia and Peru or in Brazil.\n"
"\n"
"The Tikuna live in riverside villages along the Amazonas-Solimões and its "
"tributaries, called igarapés. Their daily life revolve around the "
"cultivation cycles of different agricultural goods; specially, manioc, used "
"to produce the flour the Tikuna sell in the markets of the region’s main "
"cities. They are also fishers, hunters, and gatherers of the forest "
"products. The women make hammocks, bags, and other objects with plant "
"fibers; and the men paint on tururi fiber and fabricate arrows, paddles, and "
"canoes.\n"
"\n"
"It should be noted that, in Brazil, the Tikuna Indians live in indigenous "
"lands recognized by Brazil’s indigenous policy. They are located in "
"“terrestrial islands” among non-indigenous territories occupied by the "
"Brazilian Population, from Tabatinga to Manaus (as illustrated in the "
"Brazilian Tikuna Atlas).\n"
"\n"
"### The Astronomical Correlations\n"
"\n"
"The movements of the Tikuna constellations correspond to an interpretation "
"of the seasonality of rainfall, as the Tikuna narratives suggest. These "
"constellations are related to myths referencing the ascension and fall of "
"Wücütcha (a heavenly beast related to the Jaguar Clan), Coyatchicüra "
"(Caiman’s Jaw) and Baweta (Tracajá, the Aquatic Turtle Collective), the "
"Anteater’s fight with the Jaguar, and the Way of the Tapir.\n"
"\n"
"According to the testimony of the Tikuna indigenous people, Baweta (the "
"Pleiades Star Cluster) appears in the eastern sky towards the end of "
"November, at nightfall. After Baweta rises, Caiman’s Jaw rises. Wücütcha’s "
"leg corresponds to a portion of The Orion Constellation; and it begins to "
"disappear from the western sky around the 20th of May, at nightfall. About "
"one month earlier, the Caiman’s Jaw, corresponding to The Hyades Star "
"Cluster in Taurus, also disappears to the West.\n"
"\n"
"According to Vieira’s interpretation, the form of Baweta (the Turtle "
"Collective) is associated with the stars within the asterisms of the "
"Pleiades and of Perseus. Baweta’s eyes are the feet of Perseus (Omicron "
"Persei - Atik and ζ (Zeta) Persei). The “V” shape that Western astronomy "
"relates to the head of Taurus is called Coyatchicüra (Caiman’s Jaw). "
"Wücütcha’s Leg corresponds to the stars that groups as Orion. Its toes are "
"Orion’s Belt and the bend of the legs are ι (iota) Orionis; κ (kappa) "
"Orionis; η (eta) Leporis and δ (delta) Leporis.\n"
"\n"
"During the summer, the fight between the Anteater (Tchatü) and the Jaguar "
"(Ai) occurs. The end of the battle coincides with the death and ascension of "
"Wücütcha. The eyes of the Anteater are located in β (beta) of Triangulum "
"Australe; his claw and body is in the constellations Norma and Ara. The "
"right foot of the Jaguar is in Scorpio’s α (Antares), σ (Sigma), and τ "
"(tau); its eyes are in ε (epsilon) and μ (mu) Scorpii; and its left paw is "
"in λ (Shaula), υ (upsilon Sco – Lesath) and κ (kappa) of the same "
"constellation. Wücütcha (the Jaguar’s leg) represents the beginning of the "
"rains in late September; and its reappearance to the east follows the "
"setting of Tchatü in the west, at nightfall, in the end of November. Those "
"correlations are illuminated by indigenous testimony reproduced below:\n"
"\n"
"> “The stars fit into their respective constellations. First is Wücütcha. "
"After winter, summer begins to walk. It is the Jaguar. After him, comes "
"Coyathicüra in the month of May, at nightfall, when the Caiman’s Jaw appears "
"on the beach. Baweta appears in September, the month of the turtle. In May, "
"Wücütcha and Coyatchicüra fall. They all fall together at the end of May. In "
"July, they come again. Baweta already begins to appear in July. When "
"Wücütcha falls, beginning in May, caimans and turtles begin to appear. The "
"apex is in September.”\n"
">\n"
"> “In May, all the constellations fall, together with their planets. It is "
"summertime. Later, in July, they appear again for the New Year. Coya and "
"Wücütcha leave the sky from May to September. Later, in July, they appear "
"again.”\n"
">\n"
"> Fernando Marques or Ütchancu – translated by Lucho\n"
"\n"
"The Tikuna interpret processes affected by a succession of meteorological "
"changes that, in turn, determine the rainy and the dry seasons. In this "
"region of Western Amazon, the rainy season runs from December to March and "
"the dry season from June to September. During April, May, October, and "
"November the rainfall is intermediate. In November, the water level starts "
"to rise and in late December the tides occur. During the month of May, the "
"water level drops until September, the peak of the drought. The periods of "
"El Niño imply a rain deficit, causing the extreme drought of the great "
"river; during La Niña, the cooling of the Pacific increases the amount of "
"water, causing dramatic tides and floods.\n"
"\n"
"Although dependent on weather variability, at the September Equinox the "
"Tikuna observe how fog affects how they see in early morning; the Pleiades "
"star cluster disappears on the morning horizon in early June and reappears "
"in the evening, in late November. The goal of the Tikuna is to predict the "
"intensity of the coming rains in order to negotiate with the entity Mawü, "
"the “Master of Rain,” the effects of the floods on their subsistence "
"activities.\n"
"\n"
"According to the explanations found in Enepü (a Tikuna community in the "
"indigenous Land Eware II, in the Brazilian State of Amazon, in Western "
"Amazonia), the influence of seasonality upon Tikuna subsistence activities "
"is more prevalent along the Solimões. In the headwaters of the igarapés, "
"where Enepü is situated, plenty of food exists all year long. In Enepü, "
"trees and palms, such as the ingá and açaí, are fertile all year long due to "
"the “virginity” and the enrichment of the soil by natural compost. The same "
"thing occurs with the fishing in Lake Preto, within the limits of Enepü, "
"where they can supply themselves abundantly with fish all year long. On the "
"Solimões, however, one finds fish only from April to July, when the water "
"level drops. Abundance in the hunt is also from April to July (or September, "
"at most), along the Solimões. Fishing becomes more difficult when the river "
"is high. The fruit of the native açaí palm is collected in summer, and "
"customarily saved for preparation during winter—time of poor hunting and "
"fishing. Through planning and regular gardening, harvests are available all "
"year long. The harvest of cultivated plants also occurs during the drought "
"months. There is a certain degree of flexibility in adapting the "
"agricultural calendar to the rainy season (when fishing and hunting are not "
"productive) and the dry season, (when fishing is more abundant); however, "
"difficulties involving navigation and transport grow as the water level "
"drops along the igarapés linking the river. Traditional culture, however, is "
"not prepared for unforeseen alterations in the rainy season, such as it "
"occurred in 2002. In that year, July saw the beginning of the repiquete (the "
"rise on water levels), which normally occurs in September. This destroyed "
"the short-range agricultural cycle and made the fish scarcer, changing "
"alimentary habits.\n"

"In some circumstances separation of individual star names from &quot;star "
"path&quot; names cannot be resolved. A star may have multiple names 1) if "
"the star is part of numerous star paths and 2) since the naming of stars can "
"differ depending on which Tongan island group it originates from. The "
"nomenclature of stars is approximated based on the limited resources "
"available.\n"
"\n"
"Whilst the most-notable/common stars and constellations (i.e. Orion, "
"Pleiades, Crux) are identified in Tongan star lore there are two notable "
"exceptions. There is an absence of naming of the North star (Polaris: "
"&alpha; UMi). This is peculiar considering the latitude of the Tongan "
"islands and the prominence of this star at certain times of the year. In the "
"event of any northerly journeys from Tonga such an important navigational "
"landmark could not have possibly gone unnoticed. The constellation of "
"Scorpio (parts in, or stars of) are also absent from Tongan star lore. This "
"is surprising since the vast majority of star lore &ndash; globally and "
"Polynesian &ndash; has Scorpio as a central constellation due to it being "
"easily identified and that it is nearly directly opposite Orion in the night "
"sky. [Stellarium would welcome any further knowledge on these two "
"anomalies.]\n"
"\n"
"Common ancestry of Polynesian star lore's is evident in the similarities in "
"the labelling of stars. For example the Pleiades is called Mataliki in "
"Tongan, Matariki in Maori and Makali`i in Hawaiian.\n"

"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Constellations within Tukano astronomical culture are related with natural "
"phenomena as a whole. We gathered twelve constellations with a group who "
"speaks Tukano language. This is not the definitive number of constellations. "
"There are, surely, more constellations to be described. We presented here "
"essentially “the main cycle” (CARDOSO, 2007) of the Tukano constellations. "
"Sometimes someone relate new discoveries about these Indians sky conceptions "
"or presents new constellation descriptions. Though we are establishing "
"limits and configurations to these constellations that are new to us (non- "
"Indians), they don’t organize this body of knowledge in the same way. Their "
"conceptions about sky and Universe are different when compared with ours. "
"They don’t organize and conceive ideas about the Universe as a whole, like "
"us.\n"
"\n"
"Hereby we present few data from a research carried out with living people "
"and this data may be variable in near future. We worked with basic school "
"students, elders and story tellers comparing the talks and summarizing it as "
"you’ll see below.\n"
"\n"
"In general, we can say that a Tukano constellation, or parts of it, are "
"observed when its setting occurs, like the sunset (heliacal setting) during "
"the short period of an year. There are an amount of natural phenomena "
"related with this astronomical event. For example we can consider Aña’s head "
"setting during November and its relation with the increase and decrease of "
"the Tiquié river level. The variation of the river level is accompanied with "
"an emerging of different fishes which appear as the result of these "
"changeable natural conditions. Other larger fishes follow the first group "
"for multiple purposes (eating smaller ones for example). All of them eat "
"some fruits which eventually fall over the river surface. Ground animals and "
"microorganisms are interested on these fruits, as well as either. So, a "
"phenomenon first described as an astronomical set for us can be seen inside "
"a more complex behavior for Tukanos and their neighbors around this region. "
"Animals, plants and also spiritual manifestations are in a complex "
"relationship under the cosmological view that we can’t more ignore.\n"
"\n"
"The name of each constellation was written in this sequence: Tukano, "
"Portuguese and English. Ex. Pamõ\\Tatu\\Armadillo.\n"

"Venus was also called the dating star, &#8220;Madingeni&#8221;. Boys and "

"##### isiLimela &mdash; Pleiades\n"
"\n"
"The first sighting of &#8220;isiLimela&#8221; indicated the start of the "
"Xhosa digging or planting season. It is also said that the month of the "
"Digging Stars symbolised new life in a man for the coming-out ceremony of "
"the Abakwetha circumcision school and it has always been a custom for Xhosa "
"men to count their years of manhood from this time.\n"
"\n"
"##### iQhawe &mdash; Sirius\n"
"\n"
"Sirius is known as &#8220;iQhawe&#8221; in Xhosa, which means &#8220;the "
"champion&#8221;, probably because it is the brightest star in the night sky. "
"It can also be seen as one of two suitors or rivals (along with Canopus, the "
"second brightest star), but we cannot say for whose affections they are "
"fighting.\n"
"\n"
"##### uCanzibe &mdash; Canopus\n"
"\n"
"Canopus is the second brightest star in the heavens and is referred to as "
"&#8220;uCanzibe&#8221; in Xhosa, which means shining and sparkling. The star "
"is seen as traditional Xhosa boys dancing, or sometimes as one of two "
"suitors (Sirius, the brightest star, being the other), possibly rivals in "
"their quest for affection.\n"
"\n"
"##### umNyele &mdash; The Milky Way\n"
"\n"
"&#8220;umNyele&#8221; is the Xhosa for the raised bristles along the back of "
"the sky, like those on the back of an angry dog. It was told that the dog "
"would rise up if you point to the heaven with straight fingers. This was a "
"good deterrence and the people would remember to show respect for the god "
"&#8220;Qamata&#8221; by always pointing to the sky with a bent finger.\n"
"\n"
"##### amaKroza &mdash; Orion&#8217;s Belt\n"
"\n"
"In Xhosa the three stars of Orion&#8217;s Belt are known as the &#8220;"
"amaKroza&#8221;, or &#8220;those in a queue&#8221;. These are the graves "
"where ancestors rest peacefully, the heavens where their spirits roam and "
"the most holy place beyond the starry heavens, the dwelling of the supreme "
"god, &#8220;Qamata&#8221;."

"### Starlore\n"
"\n"
"##### isiLimela &mdash; Pleiades\n"
"\n"
"The Pleiades is a well-known cluster of stars, and normally six or seven "
"bright ones can be seen. Many of the Southern African groups believe that "
"when they first see the Pleiades in the early morning (August or early "
"September), that the start of the planting season has come.\n"
"\n"
"##### oNdwenjana &mdash; Orion&#8217;s Sword\n"
"\n"
"One of the descriptions of Orion&#8217;s Sword is as a long-stemmed flower, "
"such as a lily. However the meaning of this group of stars isn't completely "
"clear, because &#8220;oNdwenjana&#8221; could also be another tall object "
"like a tree or a man.\n"
"\n"
"##### Impanbana &mdash; Orion&#8217;s Belt\n"
"\n"
"Orion&#8217;s Belt is a combination of a crossing, dogs and wild hogs. "
"Seeing the stars of Orion&#8217;s Belt reminded hunters to be very careful "
"during their hunting trips, as it marked the mating season of the wild "
"hogs.\n"
"\n"
"##### isAndulela &mdash; Canopus\n"
"\n"
"Canopus is a bright star that appeared at harvest time and might also be "
"connected to the Red-chested Cuckoo. It was also used as a guide for "
"shepherds, marking the time to begin the journey to new grazing lands during "
"the dry season.\n"
"\n"
"##### Umthala Wezinkanyezi &mdash; The Milky Way\n"
"\n"
"Umthala Wezinkanyezi means &#8220;the stream of stars.&#8221; This is "
"related to the way the Nguni people used to fight before Shaka Zulu&#8217;s "
"revolutionary close-combat strategy. The strong warriors used to throw "
"spears like javelin and the stream of spears would be seen in the air."
