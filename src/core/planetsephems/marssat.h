I (Johannes Gajdosik) have just taken Valery Laineys Fortran code,
MarsSatV1-0.f, which he kindly supplied, and rearranged it into
this piece of software.

I can neither allow nor forbid the usage of Valery Laineys
Ephemerides of the Martian satellites.
The copyright notice below covers not the work of Valery Lainey
but just my work, that is the compilation of Valery Laineys
Ephemerides of the Martian satellites into the software supplied in this file.

My modifications to the "Ephemerides of the Martian satellites" as implemented
in MarsSatV1-0.f are
1) do not calculate constant terms at runtime but beforehand
2) unite terms with the same frequencies
