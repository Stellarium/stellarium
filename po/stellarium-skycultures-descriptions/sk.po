"The Book of Fixed Stars was written shortly before 964 AD. Dr. Paul "
"Kunitzsch described it as \"the most outstanding among the works of the "
"prominent astronomer Abu 'l-Ḥusayn 'Abd al-Raḥmān ibn 'Umar al-Şūfi (born in"
" Rayy, 903; died 986), referred to as al-Sufi. In it, al-Şūfī treats the 48 "
"classical constellations, which were established and transmitted in "
"Ptolemy's Almagest. The description of each constellation comprises the "
"following four sections: first, a general discussion of the constellation "
"and its individual stars; this section also includes alŞūfi's criticism of "
"the Ptolemaic tradition and notices of his own observations. Second, a "
"record of the indigenous Arabic star names falling under that constellation,"
" and the exact identification of the respective stars with the corresponding"
" Ptolemaic stars. Third, two drawings of the constellation, one as it is "
"seen on a celestial globe, and the other one as it is seen in the sky. "
"Fourth, a table of the stars making up that constellation, giving a verbal "
"description of each star's location and its longitude, latitude, and "
"magnitude. This table closely follows the arrangement of Ptolemy's star "
"catalogue in the Almagest.\" <sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">[1]</a></sup>. In "
"addition to the four sections of each constellation mentioned by dr. "
"Kunitzsch, Al-Sufi would identify stars within the 6 magnitudes that were "
"neglected by Ptolemy, but he did not catalogue them and was faithful to "
"Ptolemy star catalog."

"An important aspect of the general discussion section is Al-Sufi method of "
"facilitating the star identification. He describes each individual star in "
"more than way: By the star position related to the constellation figure, by "
"its magnitude, by the asterism it forms with other stars like triangle or "
"arc shapes, sometimes by the star position related to the Milky way, and by "
"the angular distance from a close by star. I have counted more than 700 "
"angular distances measured by al-Sufi in his book. The units he uses for "
"angular distances are cubits, spear length, man-height, span, and finger. "
"Al-Sufi explicitly said in his book that a cubit is equal to two degrees and"
" 20 minutes <sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\">[2]</a></sup>. For the other units,"
" Schjellerup concluded some values, but tracking the 700 measurements, I "
"came up with different values. The following table summarizes the units and "
"relationship to the cubit value from Schjellerup<sup><a "

"One hundred and forty years ago, a Boorong family at Lake Tyrrell (North-"

"1857. In his paper he wrote down the Aboriginal term and gave its European "
"equivalent.  What John Morieson has done is look closely at these celestial "

"Voyage Society (PVS), founded in 1973, created Hokule’a in 1975.  Hokule’a "

"Determination of the talismanic animals and associated star \"palaces\" "

"The term <em>koya</em> &lsquo;spirit&rsquo;, found in numerous constellation"
" names typically following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key"
" feature of Lokono astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, "
"explains that such constellations are the spirits of the corresponding "
"beings.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\">[4]</a></sup> At a time of the year when"
" the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to earth to "
"breathe life into the beings it represents. As such, the "
"<em>koya</em>-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best "
"time is to engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and "
"animals (e.g. hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where "
"such spirits would descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called "
"these places with the same names as the constellations but the evidence of "
"that remains poor. Thus, <em>Hadorhikoya</em> &lsquo;Spirit of the red "
"acouchi&rsquo; would refer to the spirit, the constellation, and the place "
"where the <em>hadorhi</em> is found in plenty when its constellation "
"appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the "
"<em>koya</em>-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the "
"plant and animal life that the Lokono possessed."

"typicky nasleduje slovo konkrétnej rastliny alebo zvieraťa a je kľúčovým "

"tieto súhvezdia sú duchmi zodpovedajúcich bytostí.<sup><a "
"href=\"#footnote-4\">[4]</a></sup> V období, kedy sa súhvezdie objaví na "

"nazývali rovnakým menom, ako súhvezdia, ale dôkazov je málo. Preto "
"<em>Hadorhikoya</em> ‘Duch akuči zeleného’ pomenúva súhvezdie, a  "
"<em>hadorhi</em> sa hojne vyskytuje, keď sa objaví súhvezdie. Tieto "

"The modern Lokono call Sirius <em>Mali</em>, the literal meaning of which is"
" unknown. Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called <em>Mali</em> "
"and explains that it is a very powerful star.<sup><a "

"August, it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or "

"<em>Mali</em> marks the beginning of the big dry season (August to "
"December), called in Lokono <em>malidalithe</em>, a term derived from "
"<em>Mali</em>. Older sources identified <em>Mali</em> tentatively as Lyra, "
"Aquila, or Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and "
"that the Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must"
" be incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the "
"Lokono territories.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-11\">[11], </a></sup><sup><a "

"Kari&rsquo;na constellation <em>Ombatapo</em> &lsquo;Previous face&rsquo;. "
"The Kari&rsquo;na myths explain the origin of the constellation and its "
"name, which, like the Lokono <em>Mali</em>, is believed to kill the fish in "
"the swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the "
"Kari&rsquo;na <em>Ombatapo </em>is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis "

"stav. Je možné z mongolčiny preložiť Pluto ako \"Princova pôda\" (pôda, nie "
"zem, pretože ide o povrch, po ktorom kráčame, nie planétu). Urán, <em"

"The zodiac definitely came to Greece from Babylonian source.  It is not "
"preserved when it had been invented there and when it was transformed to "
"Greek mathematical astronomy.  We know for sure that Hipparchus (2nd ct. "
"BCE) cites ecliptical longitudes from Eudoxus (4th ct. BCE)  with a zodiac "
"divided into 12x30 units, equaling our 360°. These direct citations from the"
" 4th century BCE suggest a much earlier invention because the concept of the"
" zodiac of 360° was very likely well established in Babylonian mathematical "
"astronomy before it was copied by Greek mathematicians.  Taking Eudoxus' "
"writing as a <em>terminus ante quem</em>, we extrapolate a date for the "
"genesis of the zodiac in Mesopotamia before 400 BCE.  In other fragments of "
"mathematical astronomy (between 800 and 700 BCE) the concept of the zodiac "
"is not present.  Some scholars argue for the 6th century BCE as date of "
"invention - but to be honest, we don't know.  The common sense is that the "
"zodiac was probably invented around the middle of the 1st millennium BCE."

"zvieratníka bola veľmi pravdepodobne založená už v babylonskej matematickej "
"astronómii, skôr ako ju skopírovali grécki matematici. Keď vezmeme Eudoxove "
"práce ako <em>terminus ante quem</em>, môžeme extrapolovať zrod zvieratníka "
"v mezopotámii pred rokom 400 p.n.l. V iných fragmentoch matematickej "
"astronómie (medzi rokmi 800 a 700 p.n.l.) nie je koncept zvieratníka. "

"The names of the planets displayed in Stellarium are names of the objects in"
" the sky and not of the gods associated with them.  The list below shows "
"that almost every asterism was associated with a deity.  According to "
"Babylonian belief, a deity has two representations: one in the sky and one "
"on Earth as statue in the temple.  That means a celestial object `is' not "
"the deity but only one of its possible expressions. This is also the case "
"for the planets.  For instance, even a millennium before MUL.APIN, the "
"goddess of sexual love and desire as well as goddess of war, the Sumerian "
"Inanna/ Akkadian Ishtar had been associated with the planet Venus.  This "
"goddess was later `translated' to the Greek Aphrodite and Roman Venus and "
"even in the Greco-Roman culture the name of the planet was Phosphoros "
"(Greek: the Luminous One) or Lucifer (Latin: the Bringer of Light) but "
"associated with the goddess.  Similar cases exist for most of the "
"constellations and single stars listed in MUL.APIN."

"Názvy planét zobrazené v Stellariu sú mená objektov na nočnej oblohe a nie "
"bohov s nimi spojených. Zoznam nižšie ukazuje, že takmer každý asterizmus "
"bol spojený s božstvom. Podľa babylonskej viery, boh mal dve reprezentácie: "
"jednu na oblohe a jednu na zemi, ako jeho socha v chráme. To znamená, že "
"nebeský objekt `nie je' božstvom, len jedným z jeho prejavov. To platí "
"rovnako pre planéty. Napríklad, už tisíc rokov pred MUL.APIN, bohyňa "
"sexuálnej lásky a túžby, ako aj bohyňa vojny, sumerská Inanna / akkadská "
"Ištar, bola spájaná s planétou Venuša. Táto bohyňa bola neskôr `preložená' "
"na grécku Afroditu a rímsku Venušu. Dokonca aj meno planéty v grécko-rímskej"
" kultúre bolo Phosphoros (grécky: Svietivý) alebo Lucifer (latinsky: Nositeľ"
" svetla), ale bolo spájané s bohyňou. Podobné príklady existujú pre väčšinu "
