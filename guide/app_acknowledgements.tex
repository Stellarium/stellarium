\section{Technical Articles}
\label{sec:ack:technical}
% 2018-02-07: Put used data from git here.

Stellarium would not look the same and work without these works from computer graphics and astronomy.

\begin{description}
	\item[The tone reproductor class]
		The class mainly performs a fast implementation of the algorithm
		from \citet{TumblinRushmeier:1993}, with more accurate values from \citet{DevlinChalmersWilkie:2002}. 
		The blue shift formula is taken from \citet{WannJensen:2000} and combined with the Scotopic vision formula from  \citet{Larson:1997}.
	\item[The skylight class]
		The class governs sky colors and is a fast implementation of the algorithm by \citet{Preetham:1999}.
	\item[The skybright class]
		The class governs physical sky brightness values based on Bradley Schaefer's  \program{VISLIMIT.BAS} basic source code \citep{Schaefer:1998}.
%		from Brad Schaefer's article on pages 57-60,  May 1998 _Sky & Telescope_,	"To the Visual Limits".

\section{Included Source Code}
\label{sec:ack:code}

\begin{itemize}		
  \item Some computation of the sidereal time (\file{sidereal\_time.h/c}) and Pluto
      orbit contains code from the libnova library (LGPL) by Liam Girdwood.
  \item The \file{orbit.cpp/h} and \file{solve.h} files were directly borrowed from
      \program{Celestia} (Chris Laurel; GPL license). They have now evolved a bit.
  \item Several implementations of IMCCE theories for planet and satellite movement by Johannes Gajdosik 
       (MIT-style license, see the corresponding files for the license text)
  \item The tesselation algorithms were originally extracted from the glues 
      library version 1.4 by Mike Gorchak \url{<mike@malva.ua>} (SGI FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE B).
  \item OBJ loader in the Scenery3D plugin based on glObjViewer (c) 2007 dhpoware

  \item The \file{SpoutLibrary.dll} and header from the SpoutSDK version 2.005 available at \url{http://spout.zeal.co} (BSD license).
\end{itemize}

\section{Data}
\label{sec:ack:data}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Hipparcos star catalog
    From ESA (European Space Agency) and the Hipparcos mission. ref. ESA, 1997, The Hipparcos and Tycho Catalogues, ESA SP-1200 \url{http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/cats/I/239}
	% TODO: NEXT ENTRY should be changed to ExplanSuppl./WGRE
\item The solar system data mainly comes from IMCCE and partly from Celestia.
\item Polynesian constellations are based on diagrams from the Polynesian Voyaging Society
% TODO: MAKE SURE THIS IS STILL VCALID WITH THE NEW VERSION 2018.
\item Chinese constellations are based on diagrams from the Hong Kong Space Museum
\item Egyptian constellations are based on the work of Juan Antonio Belmonte, Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias
\item The Tycho-2 Catalogue of the 2.5 Million Brightest Stars Hog E., Fabricius C., Makarov V.V., Urban S., Corbin T., Wycoff G., Bastian U., Schwekendiek P., Wicenec A.
    Astron. Astrophys. 355, L27 (2000)
    \url{http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/cats/I/259}
\item Naval Observatory Merged Astrometric Dataset (NOMAD) version 1 (\url{http://www.nofs.navy.mil/nomad})
    Norbert Zacharias writes:
	\begin{quotation}
    ``There are no fees, both UCAC and NOMAD are freely available with the only requirement that the source of the data (U.S.
    Naval Observatory) and original product name need to be provided with any distribution, as well as a description about any
    changes made to the data, if at all.''
	\end{quotation}
    The changes made to the data are:
	\begin{itemize}
    \item try to compute visual magnitude and color from the b,v,r values
    \item compute $\mathrm{nr\_of\_measurements} = \mathrm{the\ number\ of\ valid\ b,v,r\ values}$
    \item throw away or keep stars (depending on magnitude, nr\_of\_measurements, combination of flags, tycho2 number)
    \item add all stars from Hipparcos (incl.\ component solutions), and tycho2+1st supplement
    \item reorganize the stars in several brigthness levels and triangular zones according to position and magnitude
	\end{itemize}
    The programs that are used to generate the star files are called
    \program{MakeCombinedCatalogue}, \program{ParseHip}, \program{ParseNomad}, and can be
    found in the util subdirectory in source code. The position,
    magnitudes, and proper motions of the stars coming from NOMAD
    are unchanged, except for a possible loss of precision,
    especially in magnitude. When there is no V magnitude, it is
    estimated from R or B magnitude.  When there is no B or V
    magnitude, the color B-V is estimated from the other magnitudes.
    Also proper motions of faint stars are neglected at all.

\subsection{License for the JPL planets images}
\label{sec:ack:credits:jpl}

From \url{http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/policy/index.cfm}:
\begin{quotation}
    \noindent Unless otherwise noted, images and video on JPL public web sites (public
    sites ending with a \texttt{jpl.nasa.gov} address) may be used for any purpose
    without prior permission, subject to the special cases noted below.
    Publishers who wish to have authorization may print this page and retain
    it for their records; JPL does not issue image permissions on an image
    by image basis.  By electing to download the material from this web site
    the user agrees:
	\begin{enumerate}
    \item that Caltech makes no representations or warranties with respect to
       ownership of copyrights in the images, and does not represent others
       who may claim to be authors or owners of copyright of any of the
       images, and makes no warranties as to the quality of the images.
       Caltech shall not be responsible for any loss or expenses resulting
       from the use of the images, and you release and hold Caltech harmless
       from all liability arising from such use.
    \item to use a credit line in connection with images. Unless otherwise
       noted in the caption information for an image, the credit line should
       be ``Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech.''
    \item that the endorsement of any product or service by Caltech, JPL or
       NASA must not be claimed or implied.
    \end{enumerate}
    Special Cases:
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Prior written approval must be obtained to use the NASA insignia logo
      (the blue ``meatball'' insignia), the NASA logotype (the red ``worm''
      logo) and the NASA seal. These images may not be used by persons who
      are not NASA employees or on products (including Web pages) that are
      not NASA sponsored. In addition, no image may be used to explicitly
      or implicitly suggest endorsement by NASA, JPL or Caltech of
      commercial goods or services. Requests to use NASA logos may be
      directed to Bert Ulrich, Public Services Division, NASA Headquarters,
      Code POS, Washington, DC 20546, telephone (202) 358-1713, fax (202)
      358-4331, email \url{bert.ulrich (at) hq.nasa.gov}.
    \item Prior written approval must be obtained to use the JPL logo (stylized
      JPL letters in red or other colors). Requests to use the JPL logo may
      be directed to the Television/Imaging Team Leader, Media Relations
      Office, Mail Stop 186-120, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena CA
      91109, telephone (818) 354-5011, fax (818) 354-4537.
    \item If an image includes an identifiable person, using the image for
      commercial purposes may infringe that person's right of privacy or
      publicity, and permission should be obtained from the person. NASA
      and JPL generally do not permit likenesses of current employees to
      appear on commercial products. For more information, consult the NASA
      and JPL points of contact listed above.
    \item JPL/Caltech contractors and vendors who wish to use JPL images in
      advertising or public relation materials should direct requests to the
      Television/Imaging Team Leader, Media Relations Office, Mail Stop
      186-120, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena CA 91109, telephone
      (818) 354-5011, fax (818) 354-4537.
    \item Some image and video materials on JPL public web sites are owned by
      organizations other than JPL or NASA. These owners have agreed to
      make their images and video available for journalistic, educational
      and personal uses, but restrictions are placed on commercial uses.
      To obtain permission for commercial use, contact the copyright owner
      listed in each image caption.  Ownership of images and video by
      parties other than JPL and NASA is noted in the caption material
      with each image.

\noindent The Digitized Sky Surveys were produced at the Space Telescope Science Institute under U.S. Government grant NAG W-2166. 
The images of these surveys are based on photographic data obtained using the Oschin Schmidt Telescope on Palomar Mountain and the UK Schmidt Telescope. 
The plates were processed into the present compressed digital form with the permission of these institutions.

The National Geographic Society - Palomar Observatory Sky Atlas (POSS-I) was made by the 
California Institute of Technology with grants from the National Geographic Society.

The Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS-II) was made by the California Institute of Technology with 
funds from the National Science Foundation, the National Geographic Society, the Sloan Foundation, 
the Samuel Oschin Foundation, and the Eastman Kodak Corporation.

The Oschin Schmidt Telescope is operated by the California Institute of Technology and Palomar Observatory.

The UK Schmidt Telescope was operated by the Royal Observatory Edinburgh, with funding from the 
UK Science and Engineering Research Council (later the UK Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council), 
until 1988 June, and thereafter by the Anglo-Australian Observatory. 
The blue plates of the southern Sky Atlas and its Equatorial Extension (together known as the SERC-J), 
as well as the Equatorial Red (ER), and the Second Epoch [red] Survey (SES) were all taken with the UK Schmidt.

All data are subject to the copyright given in the copyright summary\footnote{\url{http://archive.stsci.edu/dss/copyright.html}}. 
Copyright information specific to individual plates is provided in the downloaded FITS headers.

Supplemental funding for sky-survey work at the ST ScI is provided by the European Southern Observatory.
