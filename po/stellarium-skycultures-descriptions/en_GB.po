"Alexander the Great who conquered Babylon in 331 BCE. In these days MUL.APIN"
" (already thousand years old) was still copied and, thus, appears to have "
"developed to be an old-fashioned but not outdated standard. Moreover, there "

"This <em>Seleucid</em> or <em>Late Babylonian sky culture</em> is supposed "

"regard to the MUL.APIN version have certainly applied in the zodiac since "
"several centuries. This can be stated for sure because in this time, there "

"Out of more than 1,000 stars, Ptolemy mentions a proper name for only 15.  "
"The rest are identified by fairly long descriptions such as \"The star on "
"the end of the tail\" for the Polaris. In order to avoid displaying such "
"long strings across the screen in Stellarium, we invented short labels for "
"all Almagest stars based on the constellation and the order in which they "
"appear in the catalogue.  For example, Polaris is given a designation \"UMi "
"1\" because it is the first star in the constellation of Small Bear (UMi).  "
"See the table below for the correspondence between Ptolemy constellations "
"and IAU abbreviations.  In addition, where Ptolemy describes a star as lying"
" outside of the figure, we use lowercase letters in the corresponding label."
" To see the long description for a given star, users should enable \"Use "
"additional names of stars\" in the \"View [F4]/Sky\" settings and click on "
"the star. The long description will then be displayed at the top of the "
"screen."
