**
**  For a given TT date, compute the X,Y coordinates of the Celestial
**  Intermediate Pole and the CIO locator s, using the IAU 2006
**  precession and IAU 2000A nutation models.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double  TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     x,y          double  Celestial Intermediate Pole (Note 2)
**     s            double  the CIO locator s (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The Celestial Intermediate Pole coordinates are the x,y components
**     of the unit vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference System.
**
**  3) The CIO locator s (in radians) positions the Celestial
**     Intermediate Origin on the equator of the CIP.
**
**  4) Series-based solutions for generating X and Y are also available:
**     see Capitaine & Wallace (2006) and eraXy06.
**
**  Called:
**     eraPnm06a    classical NPB matrix, IAU 2006/2000A
