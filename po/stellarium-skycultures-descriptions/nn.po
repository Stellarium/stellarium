"Anuta is a tiny volcanic island which, though located within the Solomon "
"Islands of Melanesia, is populated by Polynesians. Stars provide the "
"Anutans' most important tool for long range navigation. Major guiding stars "
"and constellations are known as 'kaavenga'. Star paths that are followed "
"from one island to the next (even if they have not risen, or already set) "
"are called 'kau panogna porau'. Unnamed stars which are not used as major "
"navigational aids are called 'petuu vare' (foolish, common, or "
"undistinguished)."

"The Book of Fixed Stars was written shortly before 964 AD. Dr. Paul "
"Kunitzsch described it as \"the most outstanding among the works of the "
"prominent astronomer Abu 'l-Ḥusayn 'Abd al-Raḥmān ibn 'Umar al-Şūfi (born in"
" Rayy, 903; died 986), referred to as al-Sufi. In it, al-Şūfī treats the 48 "
"classical constellations, which were established and transmitted in "
"Ptolemy's Almagest. The description of each constellation comprises the "
"following four sections: first, a general discussion of the constellation "
"and its individual stars; this section also includes alŞūfi's criticism of "
"the Ptolemaic tradition and notices of his own observations. Second, a "
"record of the indigenous Arabic star names falling under that constellation,"
" and the exact identification of the respective stars with the corresponding"
" Ptolemaic stars. Third, two drawings of the constellation, one as it is "
"seen on a celestial globe, and the other one as it is seen in the sky. "
"Fourth, a table of the stars making up that constellation, giving a verbal "
"description of each star's location and its longitude, latitude, and "
"magnitude. This table closely follows the arrangement of Ptolemy's star "
"catalogue in the Almagest.\" [#1]. In addition to the four sections of each "
"constellation mentioned by dr. Kunitzsch, Al-Sufi would identify stars "
"within the 6 magnitudes that were neglected by Ptolemy, but he did not "
"catalogue them and was faithful to Ptolemy star catalog."

"An important aspect of the general discussion section is Al-Sufi method of facilitating the star identification. He describes each individual star in more than way: By the star position related to the constellation figure, by its magnitude, by the asterism it forms with other stars like triangle or arc shapes, sometimes by the star position related to the Milky way, and by the angular distance from a close by star. I have counted more than 700 angular distances measured by al-Sufi in his book. The units he uses for angular distances are cubits, spear length, man-height, span, and finger. Al-Sufi explicitly said in his book that a cubit is equal to two degrees and 20 minutes [#2]. For the other units, Schjellerup concluded some values, but tracking the 700 measurements, I came up with different values. The following table summarizes the units and relationship to the cubit value from Schjellerup[#3] and from my research.\n"

"Another important aspect of Al-Sufi book is his record of the indigenous Arabic star names falling under each constellation, and the exact identification of the respective stars with the corresponding Ptolemaic stars. This means that we are looking at two layers of stars knowledge at the same time: the Ptolemaic one and the indigenous Arab one.\n"
"\n"
"### The Sky Culture\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture is a result of a research done on several manuscripts of the book, oldest of which is the [#8].\n"
"\n"
"First, the manuscripts of the Book of Fixed Stars were critically edited, and the text was produced. Second, each member star of the 48 constellations was identified according to Al-Sufi description, and new tables were built including modern star designations from the Hipparcos, Bright stars, and Bayer catalogues. Third, Arab indigenous star names were collected and identified as mapped by Al-Sufi to the Ptolemaic ones. All the previous steps were included in a book published digitally of the Book of Fixed Stars plus explanations and commentary by Khalid Al-Ajaji[#4].\n"
"\n"
"The sky culture stick figures of the constellations are the images in the Ulugh Beg manuscript of the Book of Fixed Stars, extracted, and adapted for Stellarium by Mr. Kutaibaa Akraa [#5]. The star names file includes the star number in the constellation as the primary star name and the description of the star in the tables as a secondary name. For example, Polaris primary name that is displayed with the star is: UMi1, UMi being Ursa Minor and 1 is the first star of this constellation. If the star is selected other secondary names are displayed, which will display \"The star on the end of the tail\" on the top of the screen. The constellation lines are constructed according to the constellation shapes with an attempt to include most of the member stars. For indigenous Arab star knowledge, individual star names were added to the star file as secondary names, while names of group of stars were defined through asterism names and asterism lines files.\n"
"\n"
"The translation of star descriptions from Arabic into English was extracted from Ernie Wright website[#6] which was transcribed from Toomer's translation of the Almagest[#7]. The translation was modified in a few places to agree with Al-Sufi wording.\n"
"\n"
"The single source of the sky culture is the Book of Fixed Stars and the objective is to give a faithful representation of the book content."

"The Arabic (Arabian Peninsula) sky culture reflects the oral folk tradition "
"of star names and asterisms in the Arabian Peninsula, primarily found "
"scattered in poetry and proverbs."
msgstr ""

#. Arabic (Arabian Peninsula) sky culture description section in markdown
#. format
msgid ""
"The Arabian Peninsula is a region covering the southwestern corner of Asia, bordered by the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south, the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian/Persian Gulf to the east, and the Red Sea to the west. The northern border is not precisely defined, but according to ancient geographers, it is bordered by rivers, notably the Euphrates River [#16] [#17]. This region is inhabited by Arabs and includes Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen, and parts of Syria and Iraq.\n"
"\n"
"<p><img width=\"300\" src=\"illustrations/arabian_peninsula.jpg\" /></p>\n"
"\n"
"Bedouins and farmers across the Arabian Peninsula relied heavily on stars to time their nomadic journeys, care for animals, forecast weather, and conduct agricultural activities. Stars are frequently mentioned in their proverbs and poetry. Fortunately, oral poetry and proverbs have been documented and preserved by various scholars. Surveying the collections of these scholars alongside oral traditions reveals the star knowledge of the people in this region.\n"
"\n"
"The stars used for timing are the same as those of ancient Arabs, but the system is simplified by beginning the year with the heliacal rising of al-Thurayyā, the Pleiades, at the start of summer, then counting 13 days for each lunar station, except al-Ǧabhah, which has 14 days. This results in a 27 lunar stations × 13 days + 14 days (al-Ǧabhah) = 365-day cycle. Other timing methods were also used, such as the monthly Pleiades-Moon conjunction or using stars like those of the Big Dipper.\n"
"\n"
"The sources indicate that star names and asterisms are fewer compared to those of ancient Arabs. Only the brightest stars and prominent asterisms were named and used. An important source of continuing star knowledge is the poetry of al-Ḫalāwī, a poet whose era is uncertain but estimated to be in the 17th century [#3]. Another key source is a poem by Moḥammad al-Qāḍī (~1809–1886), in which he described all 28 lunar stations, citing their local names [#2]."

"spectacular panel of Magdalenian engravings, they are supposed to be done "
"between 12.000 to 17.000 BP, the engravings are a kind of cave art that "
"normally is very difficult to see, they are sometimes almost invisible, "

"### Animal constellations\n"
"\n"
"One year later, one of the speleologists, the photographer, was studying the pictures and found out that the main panel depicted the starry firmament, the engravings were like a Paleolithic planetarium, and the animals were their constellations. Armintxe depicts the spring equinox.\n"
"\n"
"If you want to see the constellations at the same position than in the cave you can use this settings: GPS coordinates:43°21′43″N 2°30′29″W, date: -10500-6-10, hour:6am, you have to choose the art layer, they are the original pictures of the cave, the constellation layer is not so important in this case, tries to copy the original pictures. A twenty inch monitor or bigger is needed. Some of the images are easy to see on an objective way, like the tail of the lion and the second ibex, and the position between each other prove that the mere coincidence is impossible. There are other pictures almost impossible too see, their shape is very subjective, it looks like the artists were trying to find in the stars these animals to complete their calendar in a forced way.\n"

"Another characteristic of Paleolithic constellations is that they use very dim stars not the brightest, it looks like they were finding a hidden message in the stars."

"<p><img src=\"illustrations/aztec0.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"146\" align=\"left\" />For ancient aztecs, the knowledge of the night skies and stars movement had great importance for their calendars and the measurement of both agricultural and sacred cycles. However, great part of this knowledge was lost as consequence of the Spanish conquest which occurred on continental America in the 16th century.</p>\n"
"<p>The elements of the Aztec society such as culture, economy and science is preserved in the <em>tlacuilos</em>, word that comes from the ancient Nahuatl word <em>tlacuiloa</em>, which means <em>writing with drawings</em>. These Tlacuilos where stored in the <em>amoxcalli</em>, meaning amoxtli: books and calli: house. Later their became known as <em>codices</em>; a word that came from the Latin word Codex which means written book.</p>\n"
"<p>After the  Spanish conquest many of the pre-hispanic Codexes where destroyed, their main feature is that their where drawn in many different materials such as deer skin, <em>amate</em> paper or cotton fabric and they had no text only draws or <em>glifos</em>. However the collection of Mesoamerican customs continued prior to the Spanish conquest thanks to the work of some native indians and some Spanish priests, this codexes are known as Colonial Codexes and there is a change of the way of drawing because of the new techniques of drawing and the new materials imported from Europe, also because of the incorporation of descriptive text both in Spanish and Nahuatl.</p>\n"

"<p><img src=\"illustrations/Tianquiztli_T.png\" width=\"100\" height=\"107\" align=\"left\" />The group of stars that we know as Pleiades symbolized for the Mexicas <em>Tianquiztli</em>, which means market, perhaps because of the crowd that gathers on them, they're generally represented by one or two people inside a circle with goods.</p>\n"

"<p>Currently,  in Mexico the informal market or street markets are called <em>Tianguis</em>.</p>\n"

"##### Citlaltlachtli\n"
"\n"
"<p><img src=\"illustrations/citlaltlachtli_t.png\" width=\"100\" height=\"107\" align=\"left\" />The constellation of Gemini was called <em>Citlaltlachtli</em>, which means the ball game of the stars. This game was endowed with a ritual significance and used a natural rubber ball. It is said that the movement of the ball within the playing field refers to the movement of the sun and moon.</p>\n"
"\n"
"##### Xonecuilli\n"
"\n"
"<p><img src=\"illustrations/xonecuilli_t.png\" width=\"100\" height=\"107\" align=\"left\" />The Ursa Minor constellation is identified as <em>Xonecuilli</em> which means twisted foot, and is related to Nanahuatzin, this character is represented with twisted feet, filled with boils and sores, this sick and poor God sacrificed himself to become <em>Tonatiuh</em> the Sun god.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"illustrations/nanahuatzin.png\" width=\"141\" height=\"138\" /></p>\n"
"<p>Apparently, this constellation can also be associated with the Southern Cross and its surrounding stars as is referred by <em>Tezozomoc</em>. For its part, Sahagun speaks of his resemblance to bread made in the form of letter S and called by the Aztecs <em>xonecuilli</em>.</p>\n"

In turn, Tezozomoc also mentions the scorpion star  and he called it  <em>Colotlixayac</em>, which means face of a scorpion.</p>\n"
"<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"illustrations/colotlixayac_image.png\" width=\"158\" height=\"266\" /><br />\n"
"<em>Paris Codex</em></p>\n"
"<p align=\"justify\">In a section of the Paris Codex called zodiac pages appears the scorpion, in this codex the icons shows figures of animals hanging from the body of the Celestial Dragon.</p>\n"
"\n"
"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"<p align=\"justify\"> It is noteworthy that the interpretation of some of these constellations are still in discussion, and of course there must be other constellations to represent. Any comments and/or collaboration are welcome in order to preserve the stellar knowledge and meaning of the Aztec culture.</p>"

"### Zodiac\n"
"\n"
"<p>The zodiac definitely came to Greece from Babylonian source.\n"
"It is not preserved when it had been invented there and when it was transformed to Greek mathematical astronomy.\n"
"We know for sure that Hipparchus (2nd ct. BCE) cites ecliptical longitudes from Eudoxus (4th ct. BCE)\n"
"with a zodiac divided into 12x30 units, equaling our 360°. These direct citations from the 4th century BCE\n"
"suggest a much earlier invention because the concept of the zodiac of 360° was very likely well established\n"
"in Babylonian mathematical astronomy before it was copied by Greek mathematicians.\n"
"Taking Eudoxus' writing as a <em>terminus ante quem</em>, we extrapolate a date for the genesis of the zodiac in Mesopotamia before 400 BCE.\n"
"In other fragments of mathematical astronomy (between 800 and 700 BCE) the concept of the zodiac is not present.\n"
"Some scholars argue for the 6th century BCE as date of invention - but to be honest, we don't know.\n"
"The common sense is that the zodiac was probably invented around the middle of the 1st millennium BCE.</p>\n"
"\n"
"In MUL.APIN, there is definitely no zodiac but a predecessor: the path of the Moon.\n"
"There are lists of constellations or \"gods who stand in the path of the Moon,\n"
"through whose region the Moon during a month [passes repeatedly] and keeps touching them.\"\n"
"(cited from the edition by Hunger and Steele, 2018, p. 143).\n"
"This list of the MUL.APIN compendium is not considered in this sky culture; constellations in the path of the Moon are not highlighted.\n"
"\n"
"### Planets\n"
"\n"
"<p>This sky culture was made more or less only with the first list of the compendium, the so called `star catalogue'.\n"
"It is not a real star catalogue because it does not give a single coordinate and most of the names given there\n"
"are names of asterisms or constellations (and not point-like objects such as stars). The text of this first list is reproduced below - yet, we layouted it as a table to emphasis its function as an explanatory list. The catalogue also includes the names of planets: of course, planets do not have a fixed position.\n"
"However, in Mesopotamian culture it was common to mention them for a complete set of objects in the sky.\n"
"They are usually denoted (or drawn) at the position of their exaltation point (one of the later Greek <em>hypsomata</em> -\n"
"but Greek astrology provided two <em>hypsomata</em> per planet while Babylonian had only one).</p>\n"
"\n"
"The names of the planets displayed in Stellarium are names of the objects in the sky and not of the gods associated with them.\n"
"The list below shows that almost every asterism was associated with a deity.\n"
"According to Babylonian belief, a deity has two representations: one in the sky and one on Earth as statue in the temple.\n"
"That means a celestial object `is' not the deity but only one of its possible expressions. This is also the case for the planets.\n"
"For instance, even a millennium before MUL.APIN, the goddess of sexual love and desire as well as goddess of war,\n"
"the Sumerian Inanna/ Akkadian Ishtar had been associated with the planet Venus.\n"
"This goddess was later `translated' to the Greek Aphrodite and Roman Venus and even in the Greco-Roman culture the name of the planet\n"
"was Phosphoros (Greek: the Luminous One) or Lucifer (Latin: the Bringer of Light) but associated with the goddess.\n"
"Similar cases exist for most of the constellations and single stars listed in MUL.APIN.\n"
"\n"
"In the list reproduced below, the left column gives the name of the object in the sky and the right column (in most of the cases) gives the associated deity.\n"

"The Seleucid Era in Babylonian history is the era of the successors of Alexander the Great who conquered Babylon in 331 BCE. In these days MUL.APIN (already thousand years old) was still copied and, thus, appears to have developed to be an old-fashioned but not outdated standard. Moreover, there is no alternative compendium like MUL.APIN from the Late Babylonian epoch.\n"
"\n"
"<p>This <em>Seleucid</em> or <em>Late Babylonian sky culture</em> is supposed to show the (estimated) state of Babylonian constellations contemporary to the Greek culture. There is no description of the full sky. Changes with regard to the MUL.APIN version have certainly applied in the zodiac since several centuries. This can be stated for sure because in this time, there is a blossoming zodiacal astrology. Since there had been no zodiac in MUL.APIN and the zodiac developed around the middle of the -1st millennium, in the 2nd half of the 1st millennium BCE, there had been different versions of the constellations around the ecliptic.\n"
" </p>\n"
"\n"
" However, we do not know much about the rest of the sky. Hence, for the constellations far away from the zodiac, again the constellations of MUL.APIN can be taken as state of the art. Please see MUL.APIN sky culture for more information and use the MUL.APIN constellations for an impression of the Old Babylonian (or Middle Babylonian) sky culture."

"### Single Stars\n"
"\n"
" <p>\n"
" In contrast to constellations, there are much more lists of single stars preserved from the later epochs. We use this Late Babylonian or Seleucid sky culture to focus on the single star names. There are plenty of <i>ziqpu</i> lists (lists of culminating stars) and for measurements in the zodiac, \"normal stars\" have been introduced. Normal stars (from Latin \"norma\" = the measure) are a frame of reference for mathematical astrometry of the Late Babylonian epoch. While for most of the other stars the margin of error concerning their identification with a celestial counterpart is sometimes huge, the normal stars are identified properly because their coordinates can be derived from the planets standing next to them (Jones, 2004).\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"### Source(s)\n"
"\n"
"<p>The lists of ziqpu stars and normal stars are mostly compiled from the modern compendium Hunger and Pingree: Astral Science in Mesopotamia, 1999 and some of the other papers given in \"Further Reading\". The book by Hoffmann, 2017 already contains several computations with these stars and more literature (e.g. Wayne Horowitz has worked on <i>ziqpu</i> stars for many years but is not mentioned here with a special paper although his translations contributed a lot for this study). A likely version of the Late Babylonian stick figures will be added in a later release of Stellarium.\n"

"Balinese people have had a strong connection to the cosmos since ancient "
"times. They rely on the cosmos because they believe that every celestial "

#. Balinese sky culture description section in markdown format
msgid ""
"Bali, one of the provinces in Indonesia, is a strategic island for cultural exchange, as the island is located between Java and Lombok Island. Most people recognize Bali as a tourist island; meanwhile, this refers to Bali Island, not Bali Province. Aside from Bali Island, Bali province has other small islands nearby, namely Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, Nusa Ceningan, Serangan, and Menjangan. The majority of Bali's population is Balinese Hindus, who are slightly different from Indian Hindus. They also have their own language, Balinese. Bali utilizes its territory as a primary source of income through tourism. However, before the 18th century, its inhabitants made their living in agriculture and fishing. Through the original lifestyle, they have a system for determining the right time to do rituals and live by interpreting the sky.\n"
"\n"
"From its location, Balinese sky culture is one of the unique sky cultures in Indonesia due to its mixture of cultures. This sky culture has a mixture of influences from China and India through the religion transmission, Hindu-Buddhist, and trade. Polynesian influence existed earlier, given that Polynesians were accustomed to seafaring. Furthermore, it is known that most of the ancestors of Indonesians were sailors, which is supported by the fact that Indonesia is an archipelago.\n"
"\n"
"<img width=\"900\" src=\"illustrations/descr_pics/Map.png\"/>\n"
"\n"
"<i>Cultural Map that influences Balinese Sky Culture</i>\n"
"\n"
"In written form, Balinese sky culture is preserved in lontar or leaves of Borassus flabellifer or palmyra which is dried and used as a material for manuscript and antique crafts. This sky culture is related to Balinese calendar, and this system is Palelintangan. Palelintangan is a set of 35 asterisms that has a deep connection between cosmic movement and human life. Basically, they rely their daily activities based on which palelintangan is appear in that time. They believe each lintang of palelintangan has their own cosmos power to handle their work.\n"
"\n"
"Palelintangan is formed by combining seven-day cycle (from Redite/Sunday to Saniscara/Saturday) and five-day cycle (from Umanis to Kliwon). Palelintangan adopted Nakṣatra system and combining with the earlier existing concept in Bali. From all 35-lintang, four of them could not be considered as constellation. They are lintang Laweyan, lintang Děpat, lintang Dupa and lintang Srengenge. \n"
"\n"
"### Sky\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture has one small lintang system called \"Kartika\". You can see it clearly if you zoom into the Pleiades. \n"
"Balinese people are gifted in art. They use art to admire the cosmos and the gods who guard it. Consequently, the constellations depicted in this culture are found not only on palm-leaf manuscripts but also on textiles sold in the marketplace. Furthermore, they also depict them on buildings such as the Floating Pavilion, used for royal gatherings, receiving guests, and ceremonial purposes.\n"
"\n"
"### Moon and Sun\n"
"\n"
"Bali has two distinct calendars: the Pawukon calendar and the Balinese Saka calendar.\n"
"\n"
"The Pawukon calendar is a purely arithmetic calendar with a 210-day cycle, divided into 30 seven-day units called wuku. This calendar does not have a new year but begins with the Sinta wuku. This calendar is related to the Palelintangan system. Furthermore, most feast days in Bali are determined based on the Pawukon calendar.\n"
"\n"
"Next is the Balinese Saka calendar, a Balinese Hindu lunisolar calendar with a normal year consisting of 12 months. The beginning of each month is determined by the new moon (called Tilem). The waxing phase of the moon is called Penanggal, and the waning phase is called Panglong. The difference in the number of days in the solar and lunar years results in an intercalation of 11 days, which is then added to form the 13th month every three years. The New Year is called Nyepi (Silence Day), the first day of the 10th month (Sasi Kadasa). It always falls on the day after Tilem, which is closest to (but after) the March equinox. Coupled with intercalation regulations, Nyepi is kept in the mid-March to mid-April Gregorian calendar.\n"
"\n"
"For the civil calendar, in Indonesia, all regions are required to follow the national calendar. However, Bali has its calendars for religious rituals. The Balinese government eventually took the initiative to combine various calendar systems and adapt all Indonesian holidays to the one civil Balinese calendar. As a result, this calendar circulating in the community has become a complex one, consisting of the Saka Balinese calendar, the Pawukon calendar, the Saka Javanese calendar, the Chinese calendar, and the Japanese calendar. Therefore, a single date contains information from various calendar systems used in Bali.\n"
"\n"
"### Other Celestial Objects\n"
"\n"
"The Balinese consider comets to be stars, calling them lintang Dupa. Dupa is an incense. They think that comets are similar to incense. Furthermore, lintang Laweyan and lintang Děpat are unique. These two lintangs are related to the story of Kalau Rau, a powerful demon who stole the holy water (tirta amerta) that can make anybody immortality. His actions were discovered by the Sun God and Moon God. One of their weapons split the demon's head and body. His head is called lintang Laweyan, which in Vedic concept is associated with Rahu.  Meanwhile, his body is called lintang Děpat, which in Vedic concept is associated with Ketu. In astronomical concept, lintang Laweyan is the lunar ascending node, and the descending node is lintang Děpat."

"The Balinese sky culture were compiled and added to Stellarium by <em> Youla A Azkarrula: youlaafifahrvvl@gmail.com </em>. She is a researcher from Bali, Indonesia. She worked for this project based on her pre-doctoral research under supervision of Dr. Dr. Susanne M Hoffmann.\n"
"\n"
"The paintings were repainted by: <em>Jessica Gullberg </em>. She is a great artist and illustrator, created numerous original pencil drawings, watercolor paintings, and illustrations of archaeological sites, cultural artifacts, and astronomical interpretations.\n"
"\n"
"### About\n"
"\n"
"This celestial culture is essentially already partially reflected in the Balinese calendar, which is published annually by the government. Later, in a seminar held by the Bali Museum, previous research by German ethnologist and explorer Alfred Maaß was presented.\n"
"\n"
"Alfred Maaß made a report about his journey into an article titled \"Astrologische Kalender der Balinesen\"[#1]. In his article, he gave a description of each lintang in the Palelangan in the form of \"Position in the Sky\". But there are 10 lintangs that are not explained.\n"
"\n"
"Then a team from the Bali Museum continued to study deeper about the Palelintangan for the ritual. Furthermore, they mentioned a little about lintang in the form of asterism. They explained that the X-star constellation was similar to the constellation Y (the constellation set by IAU).\n"
"\n"
"With an explanation from the two main sources, we began to form Contellation Lines using Sky Culture Maker (SCM) from the description given, composed and triangulation. We have adjusted the full form of Contellation Lines to the images given by each lintang.\n"
"\n"
"In anchoring the artwork, we chose to use the re-paint image from the existing sources with the condition that using older images and in accordance with the description given by the resource persons in the Maaß article. Based on the interviews we conducted with several people, namely Hindu Religious Instructors, Chair of the Bali Dharma Hindu Association and the seminar from Balinese astronomers, that the information contained in the Maaß manuscript can be used as a reference because this information comes from traditional leaders in Klungkung. \n"

"Shown here are some interesting folk astronomy constellations found in "
"Belarus, a country in Eastern Europe bordered by Russia to the northeast, "
"Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the "
"northwest. Belarus is landlocked and contains large tracts of marshy land "
"and thousands of lakes. Forests cover about 40% of the country. Belarus is "
"exceptional in that people in the villages have preserved their traditional "
"knowledge about the stars and related beliefs, right through to the present "
"time. The illustrations are by no means exhaustive. In fact, many asterisms "
"have multiple recorded meanings, ranging from ancient to Christianized."

"One hundred and forty years ago, a Boorong family at Lake Tyrrell (North-Western Victoria, Australia) told William Stanbridge something of their stories relating to the night sky. Some forty stars, constellations and other celestial phenomena were named and located. He wrote them down and related this information to the Philosophical Institute in Melbourne in 1857. In his paper he wrote down the Aboriginal term and gave its European equivalent. What John Morieson has done is look closely at these celestial phenomena, attempt to satisfactorily identity them and to imitate the way the Boorong people may have seen them. John's interpretation was used to create the constellation figures in Stellarium.\n"
"\n"
"The Boorong were very much acquainted with the night sky, and William Stanbridge wrote in 1857 that they &quot;Pride themselves upon knowing more of Astronomy than any other tribe&quot;."

"Chinese astronomy was developed independently and Chinese had its own system"
" to connect the stars, known as \"Xingguan\" (Chinese: 星官; pinyin: xīngguān,"
" meaning: Star officials). Chinese Traditional Sky Culture has far-reaching "
"implications in East Asia. In ancient China, Xingguans and planets were "
"associated with astrology. After thousands of years of evolution, the "
"current Xingguans and star names was finalized in the 17th to 19th "
"centuries."

"Stellarium currently provides 300 Chinese Xingguans and more than 3000 Chinese star names from *Complete Studies of Astronomical* (Chinese: 仪象考成; pinyin: Yíxiàng kǎochéng) and *The Continuation of Complete Studies of Astronomical* (Chinese: 仪象考成续编; pinyin: Yíxiàngkǎochéng xùbiān). *Complete Studies of Astronomical* is an imperial record of astronomy finished in 1756. In 1844, the Imperial Astronomical Observatory made a revision to it and published *The Continuation of Complete Studies of Astronomical*, which is the major reference to the traditional Chinese Xingguans and star names used today. Yi Shitong has conducted textual research and summary of these records in his book*Chinese and Western Contrast Star Chart and Catalogue 1950.0* (Chinese: 中西对照恒星图表1950.0; pinyin: Zhōngxī Duìzhào Héngxīng Túbiǎo).\n"
"\n"
"Chinese Traditional Sky Culture is Based on the information inside *Chinese and Western Contrast Star Chart and Catalogue 1950.0* and *Complete Studies of Astronomical*.\n"
"\n"
"In addition, some stars have been added according to *The History of Stellar Observation in China* (Chinese: 中国恒星观测史; pinyin: Zhōngguó Héngxīng Guāncèshǐ) by Pan Nai, if these stars are not certified in *Chinese and Western Contrast Star Chart and Catalogue1950.0(Star Catalogue)*.\n"
"\n"
"If the star name is followed by a \"*\", it is a star added according to *The History of Stellar Observation in China*.\n"
"\n"
"If the star name is followed by a \"?\", it is a star added according to *The History of Stellar Observation in China*, but cannot be fully certified.\n"
"\n"
"### Sun, Moon and Planets\n"
"\n"
"The Western countries named the planets in mythical characters. The ancient Chinese understanding of five planets is based on five-element concepts. Therefore, Mercury is named Water Star, Venus is named Metal Star, Mars is named Fire Star, Jupiter is named Wood Star, Saturn is named Earth Star.\n"
"\n"
"In Chinese, the sun and the moon are named after Yin and Yang (with prefix \"great\" (Chinese:太; pinyin: tài)), respectively Taiyang (Sun, Chinese: 太阳; pinyin: Tàiyáng) and Taiyin (Moon, Chinese:太阴; pinyin: Tàiyīn). Their other name belongs to pictographic characters. Ri (Sun, Chinese: 日) And Yue (Moon, Chinese: 月). But the more commonly used name for the moon is Yueliang (Chinese: 月亮; pinyin: Yuèliàng).\n"
"\n"
"The sun, the moon and the five planets form Seven Luminaries (Chinese: 七曜; pinyin: qīyào), which correspond to the Five Elements and Yin and Yang.\n"
"\n"
"### Xingguans\n"
"\n"
"Traditional Chinese astronomy has a system of dividing the celestial sphere into asterisms or constellations, known as \"Xingguan\". Modern constellations refer to specific areas of the celestial sphere. Xingguans refer only to the way stars are distributed, with no specific boundaries between Xingguans.\n"
"\n"
"The name and layout of the Xingguans are very social, the kingdom, the mountains, the goods, the industry all move to the sky, according to the Earth's way in the sky to copy a world.\n"
"\n"
"The Xingguans are generally smaller than the constellations of Hellenistic tradition. A Xingguan contains more than dozens of stars, and fewer are only one. Medieval Chinese Astronomical Maps generally show a total of 283 Xingguans, comprising a total of 1,464 individual stars. The Xingguans are divided into 31 regions, the Twenty-Eight Mansions (Chinese: 二十八宿；pinyin: Èrshíbā Xiù) along the ecliptic, and the Three Enclosures (Chinese: 三垣; pinyin: Sānyuán) of the northern sky. Due to the influence of precession, six Xingguans near the southern horizon are getting more and more south. They were no longer easy to be observed by astronomers in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, so they were no longer recorded in *Complete Studies of Astronomical*.\n"
"\n"
"Before the late Ming Dynasty (17th century), there were no Xingguans around the southern celestial pole. The Southern Sky (Chinese: 近南极星区; pinyin: JìnnánJí Xīngqū) was added as a 32th region in the late Ming Dynasty based on European star charts, comprising an additional 23 Xingguans. The Southern Sky are now also treated as part of the traditional Chinese system.\n"
"\n"
"Since the late Ming Dynasty, Western missionaries entered the Imperial Astronomical Observatory. They have followed the names of the Xingguans, but changed the corresponding stars of some Xingguans, and added some stars to almost every Xingguan, called \"added stars\" (Chinese: 增星; pinyin: zēngxīng). The original stars are called \"primary stars\" (Chinese: 正星; pinyin: zhèngxīng). A Xingguan of two or more stars, each star has a number. The name of the stars in *The Continuation of Complete Studies of Astronomical* is the Xingguan plus a number. But there are also a few Xingguans, each star has a special name.\n"
"\n"
"In this way, *The Continuation of Complete Studies of Astronomical* has 300 Xingguans and 3240 stars in total.\n"
"\n"
"Until the Revolution of 1911, China no longer regarded Xingguan as the official constellation system. Unlike Xingguans, traditional Chinese star names are still used in modern Chinese astronomy, even more common than Western names.\n"

"Three Enclosures is three regions in the northern sky surrounded by the ecliptic. Three Enclosures is Purple Forbidden Enclosure (Chinese: 紫微垣; pinyin: Zǐwēiyuán), Supreme Palace Enclosure (Chinese: 太微垣; pinyin: Tàiwēiyuán), Heavenly Market Enclosure (Chinese: 天市垣; pinyin: Tiānshìyuán).\n"
"\n"
"Each Enclosure has two walls, called the left wall and the right wall which are the main Xingguans. The walls are surrounded by many Xingguans. There are also Xingguans in the vicinity of the wall that belong to this Enclosure.\n"
"\n"
"Purple Forbidden enclosure is the inner palace of the emperor, it covers the northernmost area of the night sky. From the viewpoint of the ancient Chinese, the Purple Forbidden Enclosure lies in the middle of the sky and is circled by all the other stars. It covers the modern constellations Ursa Minor, Draco, Camelopardalis, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Auriga, Boötes, and parts of Ursa Major, Canes Venatici, Leo Minor, Hercules. Purple Forbidden enclosure has 37 Xingguans.\n"
"\n"
" - [Purple Forbidden enclosure (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Forbidden_enclosure)\n"
"\n"
"Supreme Palace Enclosure is the place where the emperor and the courtiers deal with their politics. Supreme Palace Enclosure has a variety of officials and government agencies. It covers the modern constellations Virgo, Coma Berenices and Leo, and parts of Canes Venatici, Ursa Major and Leo Minor. Supreme Palace Enclosure has 20 Xingguans.\n"
"\n"
" - [Supreme Palace Enclosure (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Palace_enclosure)\n"
"\n"
"Heavenly Market Enclosure is a bazaar in the sky, a place where ordinary people live. The Heavenly Market Enclosure covers the modern constellations Serpens, Ophiuchus, Aquila and Corona Borealis, and parts of Hercules. Heavenly Market Enclosure has 19 Xingguans. They were named after the participants of the bazaar and the facilities of the bazaar.\n"

"### Twenty-Eight Mansions\n"
"\n"
"The Twenty-Eight Mansions (Chinese: 二十八宿; pinyin:Èrshíbā Xiù) also known as 28 Lunar Mansions are the ancient China divisions of the ecliptic and the sky area near the equator to divide the ecliptic into 28 regions according to the right ascension. Each region is called a Mansion (Chinese: 宿; pinyin:Xiù), The ancients let the Moon change a Mansion every day to rest.\n"
"\n"
"Each Mansion has a Xingguan of the same name near the ecliptic, which is the main Xingguan. Where the Xingguans in this area belongs to the Mansion.\n"
"\n"
"Each Xingguans has a main star know as determinative star (Chinese: 距星; pinyin: jùxīng). In ancient China, the determinative stars of Twenty-eight Mansions was the benchmark for determining the longitude of the equatorial coordinate system. The right ascension difference between the determinative stars of two adjacent Mansions is the equatorial mansion degrees (Chinese: 宿度; pinyin: xiùdù) of the western Mansion. The traditional equatorial coordinate system of China divides the equator into 365.25 degrees, and the Sun runs one day for one degree, which is also the sum of the equatorial mansion degrees of the 28 Mansion.\n"
"\n"
"Due to the influence of precession, the equatorial mansion degrees of each Mansion has been slowly changing, and some determinative stars have also changed in history.\n"
"\n"
"On traditional Chinese star maps, there are 28 lines passing through the determinative stars of The Twenty-Eight Mansions from the north celestial pole as their boundaries to facilitate the positioning of celestial bodies.\n"
"\n"
"If a celestial body is east of the determinative star of a Mansion, and its right ascension does not exceed the determinative star of the next Mansion, the difference in right ascension between this celestial body and the determinative star, is know as mansion distance degrees (Chinese: 入宿度; pinyin: rùxiùdù).\n"
"\n"
"Coupled with the polar distance degrees(Chinese: 去极度; pinyin: qùjídù), which is the angular distance between the star and the north celestial pole, we can determine the position of a star on the celestial sphere. Mansion distance degrees and polar distance degrees together constitute the two components of the ancient Chinese equatorial coordinate system.\n"
"\n"
"The Twenty-Eight Mansions are grouped into Four Symbols (Chinese: 四象; pinyin: sìxiàng), each associated with a compass direction and containing seven Mansions, corresponds to Seven Luminaries. The correspondence between the Twenty-Eight Mansions and the Four Symbols is based on the sky at dusk on the vernal equinox in a certain period of ancient times. At this time, the Vermilion Bird is in the south, the Azure Dragon is in the east, the Black Tortoise is in the north, and the White Tiger is in the west.\n"

"### The Southern Sky\n"
"\n"
"The sky around the south celestial pole was unknown to ancient Chinese. Therefore, it was not included in the Three Enclosures and Twenty-Eight Mansions system. However, in the late Ming Dynasty, Xu Guangqi (Chinese: 徐光启; pinyin: Xú Guāngqǐ) introduced another 23 Xingguans based on the European star charts. These Xingguans were since incorporated into the traditional Chinese star maps. These Xingguans are actually variations of Western constellations, and they are mostly named after animals.\n"

"This Sky Culture is based on the information inside *Chinese and Western Contrast Star Chart and Catalogue 1950.0 (Star Catalogue)* (Chinese: 中西对照恒星图表1950.0(星表分册)) and *Complete Studies of Astronomical* (Chinese: 仪象考成).\n"
"\n"
"Thanks to Liu Chunbin for the collation of the *Chinese and Western Contrast Star Chart and Catalogue 1950.0 (Star Catalogue)*. He produced *Chinese Star Catalogue for Stellarium* (Chinese: Stellarium 中国星官体系下中文星名扩展包) which is a very important reference.\n"
"\n"
"Some stars have been added according to *The History of Stellar Observation in China* (Chinese: 中国恒星观测史).\n"
"\n"
"For the translation of constellations, we use the *English-Chinese Glossary of Chinese Star Regions, Asterisms and Star Names* (Chinese: 中国星区、星官及星名英译表) by Hong Kong Space Museum. Only a small portion of the translation is changed, for example, when the translations of the two different Xingguans are the same.\n"
"\n"
"The cultural connotations of the name cannot be explained perfectly, because thousands of years passed, the connotations behind some names are controversial. These are only possible translations. Chinese characters are ideographic characters, which leads to some completely different names having the same pronunciation. Therefore, the pinyin transliteration is provided only to make star names readable."

"### The Evolution of Chen Zhuo Constellations\n"
"\n"
"The integration of the Three Schools constellations by Chen Zhuo (230s-320s CE) is a milestone in the history of Chinese astronomy. The \"Three Schools constellations\" refer to those created by Shi school, Gan school, and Wu Xian school, named after Shishen (石申) and Gande (甘德) from the Warring States period and Wuxian (巫咸), a legendary astronomer from the Shang dynasty (1600 BCE - 1046 BCE). Research suggests the formation of these constellation systems occurred during the Han Dynasty (202 BCE - 220 CE). Later, during the Three Kingdoms (220 CE - 280 CE) or Western Jin (265 CE - 316 CE) period, the Grand Historian Chen Zhuo synthesized these traditions into a new system, encompassing 283 constellations and 1,464 stars.\n"
"\n"
"However, over this long transmission period, the positions and shapes of Chen Zhuo constellations underwent noticeable changes due to transcription errors on star maps. The Northern Song constellations, as reflected in the Huangyou Star Catalog, the *Xin yixiang fayao* star map, and the Suzhou Star Map already show clear differences from those of Chen Zhuo and the original Three Schools in Han dynasty.\n"
"\n"
"### Reconstruction of the Earliest Chen Zhuo Constellations\n"
"\n"
"The primary works of Chen Zhuo and the Three Schools have been lost, and much of the early documentation of their constellations is no longer extant. While some data from the Shi school survived in Tang dynasty texts like the *Kaiyuan zhanjing* (开元占经, Divination Canon of Kaiyuan Reign) and the *Tiandi ruixiangzhi* (天地瑞祥志, Treatise on Celestial and Terrestrial Omens), early positional descriptions for the Gande and Wuxian constellations exist only in fragments. This scarcity of materials has long hindered scholars' efforts to reconstruct and understand early Chinese sky.\n"
"\n"
"Recently, Boshun YANG discovered new records of stellar coordinates that differ from previously known star catalogs like Jingyou and Huangyou. These records encompass the 28 lodges (xiu) as well as constellations from the three schools. After research, he found it is a star catalog formed by Chen Zhuo based on the integration of the coordinate data of the three schools in the Han Dynasty. The Shi School data not only correct Tang Dynasty records but also include previously unrecorded information. More significantly, the Gande and Wuxian data are entirely novel and originate from Han dynasty observations. Further research indicates that these data were primarily observed during the Han Dynasty, aligning well with descriptions in the *Three Schools’ Star Canons* and early star maps like the *Cheonsang Yeolcha Bunyajido*, the Dunhuang Star Map, and the *Gezi yuejin tu*. This discovery has proven crucial for reconstructing the early Chinese sky.\n"
"\n"
"The majority of the early celestial officials can be reliably restored by combining the Chen Zhuo catalogue, the *Three Schools’ Star Canons*, and the early star maps. Due to the errors in the star tables and maps, as well as the ambiguity in the early text descriptions, a small number of constellations may require further improvement.\n"
"\n"
"### Scientific Value and Cultural Significance of Early Constellations\n"
"\n"
"The Chinese constellation system offers unique contributions to modern astronomical research. Ancient Chinese astronomers conducted detailed and prolonged observations, leaving extensive records of phenomena like meteors, comets, guest stars, and auroras, all referenced against constellations. Restoring early constellations aids in accurately locating these events, enhancing the application of ancient records in contemporary astronomy. For instance, the early Purple Palace in this sky culture has been instrumental in identifying the ancient counterpart of the nova remnant Z Cam.\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture preserves the original appearances and positions of numerous star groupings, with some examples highlighted below.\n"
"\n"
" - **Shape**: The *Huagai* (华盖, Canopy of the Emperor) constellation initially resembled some ceremonial parasols used by Han emperors, while later depictions evolved into circular or irregular shapes, losing their cultural connotation. The *Neijie* (内阶, Inner Steps) was modeled after the *Santai* (三台, Three Steps; also known as *Tianjie* (天阶, the Heavenly Steps); they serve as paths that connected the *Zigong* (紫宫, Purple Palace), *Taiwei* (太微, Supreme Palace), and *Wenchang* (文昌, Administrative Centre), symbolizing imperial pathways. Thus, it has a shape of staircase.\n"
" - **Position**: The *Tianfu* (天桴, Celestial Drumstick) was originally located near the *Hegu* (河鼓, Drum at the River) and this position is in line with its astrological meaning. Over time, it was gradually moved downward, and its connection with *Hegu* gradually weakened. Similarly, the *Lishi* (砺石, Whetstone) was initially placed near the *Wuche* (五车, Five Chariots), whose northwest star, *Tianku* (天库, Celestial Arsenal), represented generals and military affairs. Since *Lishi* can sharpen blades, it was located below *Tianku* to assist it, aiming to make weapons sharp and achieve victory. After the Song dynasty, the Whetstone moved near the *Juanshe* (卷舌, Rolled Tongue), diverging from its original intent.\n"
"\n"
"The initial shapes and arrangements of the Three Schools constellations were meticulously designed by their creators, with some configurations mirroring the forms of real-world objects, and spatial relationships encoding astrological meanings. These original meanings were often lost as the constellations evolved over time.\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture is thus invaluable for uncovering the original scientific and cultural meanings embedded in early Chinese constellations."

"### Medieval Xingguans\n"
"\n"
"From the Three Kingdoms Period to the Ming Dynasty, covering the whole of the Middle Ages, China's star map is similar.\n"
"\n"
"The Xingguans originated in ancient times. Wuxian (巫咸) of Shang Dynasty(16th century BC-1046 BC), Gan De (甘德) and Shi Shen (石申) of The Warring States Period (475–221 BC), created their own Xingguan system respectively. During the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD), Chen Zhuo (陈卓) summarized the Xingguans system of Gan De, Shi Shen and Wuxian, including 283 Xingguans and 1464 stars. Since then, Xingguan system has been basically defined, and after a thousand years, there has not been much change. Since the 17th century, Western astronomy has had an impact on Chinese astronomy, and the shape and number of Xingguans have changed significantly. Only about half of the constellations maintained the medieval style.\n"
"\n"
"Determinative star is an important concept. In the Middle Ages, Chinese astronomers did not name all stars, and each Xingguans was chosen as a major star called determinative star. In ancient China, astronomical measurements measured its coordinate position, and other stars in the Xingguan were rarely mentioned. However, some important constellations will be selected more stars for observation and recording. In ancient China, astronomers used mansion distance degrees (determinative star distance) and polar distance degrees to record the position of stars. **In ancient China, the determinative stars of Twenty-eight Lunar Mansions was the benchmark for determining the longitude of the equatorial coordinate system**.\n"
"\n"
"The *Song of the Sky Pacers* (步天歌) is an early Chinese star catalogue in the form of poem in heptasyllabic verse, enumerating the names of stars.\n"
"\n"
"Below is *Xinyixiangfayao Star Map* from Su Song(苏颂, 1020-1101 AD).\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"### Restore Sky Map\n"
"\n"
"The sky map of the Song dynasty is typical of the Chinese medieval sky map. In 1052 AD, the Song Dynasty official conducted accurate stellar measurements, leaving a lot of data.\n"
"\n"
"Pan Nai(潘鼐) collated these astronomical observations data and based on the *Xinyixiangfayao Star Map*, he restored most of the Song Dynasty's Xingguan in his masterpiece *The History of Stellar Observation in China*, which is the most important reference book. Qi Rui (齐锐) and Wan Haoyi (万昊宜) also restored the Xingguans of the Song Dynasty in the book *Roving China Heavens*, which is also an important reference book.\n"
"\n"
"Due to the limitation of observation conditions in Song Dynasty, combined with instruments, circulated errors and other reasons, different scholars restored the sky map is somewhat different.\n"
"\n"
"Based on these books, Stellarium can almost truly present the Chinese medieval sky map of Huangyou four years (1052 AD).\n"

"### Planets\n"

"Taiyang (太阳), Sun. The name comes from yin and yang, meaning a lot of yang,\n"

"Taiyin (太阴), Moon. The name comes from yin and yang, meaning a lot of Yin,\n"
"\n"
"Chen Star (辰星), Mercury. Chen is an angle unit, which refers to about 30 degrees. Mercury is always within 30 degrees of the sun.\n"
"\n"
"Taibai (太白), Venus. Taibai means big and white.\n"
"\n"
"Yinghuo (荧惑), Mars. The colors of Mars are like fire, and movement is confusing.\n"
"\n"
"Sui Star (岁星), Jupiter. It means the old star. Jupiter travels around the celestial sphere for a week every 12 years. The ancients took Jupiter's position as the standard of the chronology.\n"
"\n"
"Zhen Star (填星), Saturn. Zhen, means passing Lunar Mansions. Saturn travels around the celestial sphere about every 28 years. Saturn will pass through a Lunar Mansion every year."

"<p>The sculptured Dendera zodiac (or Denderah zodiac) is a widely known "
"Egyptian bas-relief from the ceiling of the pronaos (or portico) of a chapel"
" dedicated to Osiris in the Hathor temple at Dendera. This chapel was begun "
"in the late Ptolemaic period when Egypt was ruled by (Greek) successors of "
"Alexander the Great (hellenistic Egypt: 305-30 BCE). Its <i>pronaos</i> (a "
"hall in front of the holy chamber) was added by the Roman emperor Tiberius "
"(14-37 CE). This led Jean-François Champollion (18th century) to date the "
"relief to the Greco-Roman period (while most of his contemporaries believed "
"it to be of a millennium earlier because of the Egyptian style of the "
"figures - this is not believed anymore). Today, French archaeologists date "
"it to exactly 54 BCE [1].  The relief is now on display at the Musée du "
"Louvre, Paris (France).</p>"

"### Zodiac\n"
"\n"
"The zodiac came to Greece from Babylonian sources. It is unknown whether or not the Egyptians had similar figures: The origin of the zodiac is the path of the Moon and was, thus, important for the Egyptian calendar, too. However, the zodiac depicted in Dendera is definitely the Greek (partially misunderstood) interpretation of the Babylonian one.\n"
"\n"
"The Zodiac is the Babylonian one with the semi-exception of Pisces: Pisces are depicted as two fish which is never found in Babylon and only an analogon is known in Late Babylonian epoch in the city of Uruk. In Uruk, the constellation  was changed to the constellation of the Swallow-Fish connecting a swallow and a fish. In contrast, in Babylon it has always been \"The Tails of the Giant Swallow\" (Steele 2018).\n"
"\n"
" The other constellations of the zodiac are the Babylonian versions, partially egyptized. Virgo is depicted as the Babylonian Goddess Shala with the Ear of Grain, Capricornus as a Goat-Fish accompanying the Babylonian god of witchcraft (Aquarius), Sagittarius as the Babylonian god Pabilsang. Scorpion, Aries and Cancer leave rather no room for interpretation. Leo is depicted as a usual lion but carries the Egyptian queen Berenice (whose name was given to the constellation Coma Berenices) at his tail. Gemini are not depicted as Twins but as a couple, the Bull is not halved.\n"
"\n"
"### Outside the Zodiac\n"
"\n"
"The rest of the sky  also shows a mixture of several cultures: The hippo goddess who guards the Ox Thigh is a clearly Egyptian constellation. Interestingly, there is a desert fox and a sheep next to the ox thigh which refers to same positions in the sky as the Babylonian constellations of the Fox and the Ewe.\n"
"\n"
"In contrast to these native Egyptian constellations, there are also native Sumerian ones that are depicted in an Egyptized way: This is marked in the \"Translation\" of the Stellarium labels.\n"
"\n"
"Interestingly, this depiction explains several Greek names of single stars: e.g. at the position of Capella, there is a whitish Goat in the Dendera ceiling, and at the position of the star Canopus whose name is already attested in Ptolemy's Almagest, there is a Horus-falcon on a canopy jar. It suggests that these were originally Egyptian images that have been transformed to star names in a later epoch in order to commemorate the outdated constellations.\n"

#. Greek (Almagest) sky culture introduction section in markdown format
msgid ""
"<p>This ancient Greek sky culture is compiled in a book that is today known by its Arabic title \"Almagest\".\n"
"This book was written in Roman time (under the reign of Roman emperor Hadrian) at Alexandria (Africa) in\n"
"Greek language, with dates given in Egyptian month names and years counted after a Babylonian king,\n"
"so it is clearly a multi-cultural compendium of knowledge. It is a compilation of\n"
"astronomical knowledge of former astronomers including results from\n"
"observations and mathematical astronomy. Pieced together by Claudius\n"
"Ptolemy, using older, as well as his own, observations, it was written\n"
"in Greek, published in the Second Century and remained the main\n"
"astronomical work for the following 1500 years. It was originally written\n"
"with the title <i>Mathematike Syntaxis</i>, in Ancient Greek.\n"
"The name <i>Almagest</i>, meaning &ldquo;The Largest [Book]&rdquo;, was\n"
"developed from Arabian translations. To create this sky culture we used\n"
"the English translation by Toomer (1984), reworked it in some details\n"
"(e.g. using more literal translations from Greek instead of Latin terms that\n"
"are common today) and we made use of computer readable tables prepared\n"
"by Ernie Wright.</p>"
msgstr ""

#. Greek (Almagest) sky culture description section in markdown format
msgid ""
"The Almagest consists of 13 sections, called books. In the seventh\n"
"and eighth book, Ptolemy listed a total of 1022 stars in 48 constellations\n"
"(among which are about 5 star-like objects like globular star clusters).\n"
"It is a table of coordinates of the stars with a description of their\n"
"position in the constellation (such as \"star at the elbow of X, longitude,\n"
"latitude, magnitude\"). With regard to precession, Ptolemy used ecliptic\n"
"coordinates. As one of the first of his time, Ptolemy included the\n"
"magnitude, a quantitative scale of stellar brightness, probably adopted\n"
"from Hipparchus (which is not certain because Hipparchus&rsquo; catalog\n"
"is not preserved). The scale starts with the brightest star with the\n"
"magnitude of 1, going down to magnitude of 6, for the faintest stars\n"
"visible.\n"
"\n"
"<p>For the computation of planet positions Ptolemy used a geocentric model\n"
"(which is allowed because the observer always stands on Earth) and, thus,\n"
"contributed to the scientific belief that the heliocentric model by\n"
"Aristarch was not needed. However, for the star catalogue of the\n"
"<i>Almagest</i> this does not matter at all because a star catalogue\n"
"always represents a sort of inventory of the fixed dots in the sky and\n"
"Ptolemy's proclaimed aim of the catalogue is to provide a list for making\n"
"a celestial globe (see Alm., VIII, 3). Being aware of precession he wants\n"
"to ease the business of future globemakers by using ecliptical coordinates:\n"
"Precession as known to Ptolemy shifts all stars parallel to the ecliptic,\n"
"therefore updates to the epoch of the respective globemaker could be\n"
"applied by a simple subtraction of the value for ecliptic longitude.</p>\n"
"\n"
"### How this sky culture was made\n"
"\n"
"### Star names\n"
"\n"
"Out of more than 1,000 stars, Ptolemy mentions a proper name for only 15.\n"
"The rest are identified by fairly long descriptions such as \"The star on\n"
"the end of the tail\" for the Polaris. In order to avoid displaying such long\n"
"strings across the screen in Stellarium, we invented short labels for all\n"
"Almagest stars based on the constellation and the order in which they appear in\n"
"the catalogue.  For example, Polaris is given a designation \"UMi 1\" because\n"
"it is the first star in the constellation of Small Bear (UMi).  See the table\n"
"below for the correspondence between Ptolemy constellations and IAU abbreviations.\n"
"In addition, where Ptolemy describes a star as lying outside of the figure,\n"
"we use lowercase letters in the corresponding label. To see the long description\n"
"for a given star, users should enable \"Use additional names of stars\" in the\n"
"\"View [F4]/Sky\" settings and click on the star. The long description will then\n"
"be displayed at the top of the screen.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellation lines\n"
"\n"
"The process can be described as sketched here with the example of\n"
"Corvus:\n"
"\n"
"In the constellation of Corvus (Raven), &alpha; Crv is the star in\n"
"the &quot;head of the raven&quot;. It is connected with the &quot;star\n"
"in the neck&quot;, &epsilon; Crv.  This one is connected with &quot;the\n"
"star in the breast&quot; &zeta; Crv.  From there two lines go to the\n"
"tips of the wings. &gamma; Crv is the star in the advanced wing and\n"
"&delta; Crv the star in the rear wing. From the star in the breast\n"
"another line goes to the &quot;foot of the raven&quot;, the star &beta;\n"
"Crv.\n"
"\n"
"<p><img width=\"800\" src=\"illustrations/corvus_s.png\" /></p>\n"
"<p>After identifying the stars based on their coordinates and names, we\n"
"reconnected the stars according to the descriptions in the table\n"
"presented in the <i>Almagest</i>.</p>\n"
"<p>The names of stars and names of deep sky objects rely on the Almagest\n"
"only, e.g. Ptolemy uses the name &quot;&lambda;&alpha;&mu;&pi;&alpha;&delta;&#943;&alpha;&sigmaf;\n"
"(The Torch-like)&quot; for Aldebaran in his other work, the\n"
"<i>Tetrabiblos</i>, but this is not implemented in this sky culture because\n"
"it doesn't show up in the Almagest.</p>\n"

#. Greek (Dante) sky culture introduction section in markdown format
msgid ""
"Dante Alighieri mentions several stars and a few constellations: predominantly, the zodiacal constellation of Gemini. The Twins occurs in his texts (in the comedia as well as his poems). As Dante is not an astronomer but a person with broad knowledge, his view of the constellations is highly like not based upon observations of the sky but on manuscripts that he read. Therefore, we chose to take the zodiacal constellation images from Michael Scotus whose manuscript was very popular in Dante's time.\n"
"\n"
"Dante Alighieri was a citizen of Florence, Italy, who was later banned and lived at several places in Northern Italy. The comedia was written around 1300 but finished only short before his death in 1321. It is commonly assumed that the story plays in around the Christian festival of Easter in 1300 CE."

"### How this Sky Culture was made\n"
"\n"
"The Dante experts of the German Dante Society selected some text passages with astronomical references in order to present them at Planetarium Jena in the dome. Professor Blume's suggestion that Dante likely had Michael Scotus's drawings of the constellations in mind was accepted. Therefore, we copied these drawings and mapped them onto the stars. The \"16\" bright stars that are mentioned by Dante are usually interpreted by romanists as the stars of first magnitude in the Almagest. Therefore, these stars where highlighted with the \"star\"-symbol in Stellarium. Additionally, we painted a chariot (wagon) and a horn.\n"
"\n"
"Dante calls the seven bright stars of Ursa Major \"The Chariot\", the constellation of Ursa Minor \"The Horn\", and possibly refers to Corona Borealis when he mentions a ring of stars. The latter interpretation is in our view unlikely but is discussed among researchers which is why we marked the stars of Corona Borealis as it is described in the Almagest."

"This ancient Greek celestial culture is based on the marble globe of the "

"The marble globe only depicts figures and no stars. The globe has a diameter of about 65 cm. The figures were not aligned according to exact point coordinates, but in a grid: the ecliptic, the celestial equator, the tropics and the polar circles provide orientation in terms of position in \"latitude circles\" on the celestial sphere, while the coluric circles provide a four-way division in \"longitude circles\". Ancient globe makers used this very coarse-meshed grid to adjust the figure drawings.\n"

"The images of the globe therefore clearly show that the stonemason who created the globe had the popular doctrinal poem by Aratos of Soloi (~300 BCE) in mind. There is no reason for the claim - often inflated by popular science - that this marble globe was carved according to Hipparchus' star catalogue. This thesis has been repeatedly raised over the past ~200 years, but regularly dismissed: Both mathematical arguments and artistic representations speak against it.\n"

"Only the torso of the man was preserved and with broken elbows: everything below the hip has been supplemented in a modern way. In this form, the sculpture is 2.10 m high. The sculpture of the globe with constellations, which is important for us, is original, but has a large hole at the north pole - presumably it was anchored there to other parts of the architecture. Therefore, the circumpolar constellations of the two she-bears and parts of the dragon are missing.\n"
"\n"
"### How was this Sky Culture made?\n"
"\n"
"The illustrations of the individual figures were copied from the marble globe as pencil sketches. Stellarium works with point coordinates of the modern HIPPARCOS catalogue (produced by an astrometry satellite), so that the historical drawings have to be locked at three points (stars) each. Since this sometimes leads to distortions in historical figures (the marble globe is not a perfect sphere, the figures were not fitted according to point coordinates), this was done here \"by eye\" - just as by the historical stonemason.\n"
"\n"
"The names of the constellations and individual stars were taken from the Almagest star catalogue, which also dates from the 2nd century (i.e. the reign of the Roman Emperor Hadrian) and - as was customary at the time - was written in Greek as scientific literature.\n"
"\n"
"The marble globe was a decorative element in a building, probably a particularly elaborate capital. It has no scientific accuracy. Therefore, some drawings in relief deviate from the exact star positions of the star catalogue: e.g. the Twins (Gemini) are moved slightly to the side to show the figure completely, although the lower part of this celestial region would be covered by the hand of the Atlas statue. There are similar distortions in the Scorpion.\n"
"\n"
"The following table lists the original Greek names of the constellations in columns 2 and 3, and in column 4 the image on the globe.\n"

"This is a manuscript from the Carolingian period, two copies of which are known so far. One was found in Metz (France), the other in Leiden (Netherlands). It dates to the reign of the Carolingian king Louis the Pious (778-840), who may have been the patron himself (or his wife).\n"
"\n"
"The manuscript was probably created around 816 to 825 in Aachen or Metz (Lorraine) and was made with such expensive material that a royal patron is suspected. It comprises 99 parchment leaves, each of which measures 22.5 by 20.0 cm (i.e. approximately square with the width of DIN A4). In addition to graphic representations of planetary orbits and other didactic visualisations, this manuscript also contains 35 full-page miniatures depicting the ancient figures behind the constellations."

"The figures are drawn from a non-preserved Roman model, but not from a globe, so that there is no fit to the stars. The stars themselves are only symbolically distributed on the figures, i.e. the number of stars per figure is marked in the manuscript in the form of applied gold leaves. The gold leaves, however, are not located at the true places of the stars in view of the figure in the sky, but are only indicated summarily. Elly Decker's essay discusses her proposed identifications in detail.\n"

"\n"
"### How this Sky Culture was made\n"
"\n"
"The illustrations of the individual figures were taken directly from the manuscript (provided by Prof. D. Blume, Jena, for planetarium applications). Stellarium works with point coordinates for stars in the catalogue of the astrometry satellite HIPPARCOS, so that the historical drawings have to be locked at three points each. Some of the flat book illustrations had to be distorted slightly on the planetarium dome to fit the stars. Except for the illustration of Scorpius and Ophiuchus, an approximate adjustment was possible.\n"
"\n"
" In a planetarium dome, i.e. against a dark background, the dark blue and black parts of the manuscript are not recognisable. That is why these parts (e.g. the crab as a figure, the horns of the ibex, the goats of the carter...) were colour-inverted. The female bears, which are supposed to be dark, have only been shifted slightly into the red. How the image looks in the original (with its lapis lazuli blue background and the original dark colours) is shown in the table below.\n"
"\n"
"There are some constellations in the Leiden Aratea, in particular Cen + Lup, Vir, Lib are leaving a huge gap in the sky.\n"
"Both, Virgo and Centaur are probably not painted because the painter thought it were variants of the images of Sgr (Cen) and And (Vir).\n"
"The artist of the Leiden Aratea never mapped the images onto the stars.\n"
"In order to make these depictions understandable for us, I mapped them in Stellarium and added the names and stickfigures of the constellations and the names of individual stars from the Almagest.\n"
"The Almagest is a book of mathematical astronomy of the 2nd century (i.e. the reign of the Roman Emperor Hadrian) while Aratos's poem describes a much earlier (~300 BCE) Greek sky culture.\n"
"Both, the Almagest and the poem, are written in Greek originally but the Leiden Aratea presumably refers to a Latin translation of Aratus' poem and Roman artwork.\n"
"\n"
"The following table lists the original names of the constellations in columns 2 and 3. constellations, in column 4 the illustration in the manuscript.\n"

"### History\n"
"\n"
"The knowledge of Hawaiian star navigation has been passed down orally for many generations.   Much of the knowledge regarding stars and navigation were lost until the Hawaiian Renaissance in the early 1970s. Polynesian Voyage Society (PVS), founded in 1973, created Hokule’a in 1975. Hokule’a is a traditional Hawaiian voyaging canoe with the mission to revive the art of way finding. A man from Satawal, Micronesia named Mau Piailug was a master navigator/wayfinder. The knowledge of wayfinding and using the sky to navigate was passed down to Mau from his ancestors. Nainoa Thompson, current President of PVS, asked Mau to teach his knowledge of navigation to him with the intention of reviving the knowledge that was once lost to the Hawaiians. With the knowledge learned from Mau, the Hawaiian star compass and star lines were created.\n"
"\n"
"### Star Lines\n"
"\n"
"Each star line is a group of main stars that will be remembered by the navigators. The stars connect making constellations. Navigators remember the rising/setting houses of these stars, the stars that connect in each line, and the lines that point directly to North and South. The star lines’ position in the night sky slowly change over time, each starline being more prevalent at night according to the season. The star lines with their according season are as follows:\n"

"### <notr>Ke Ka o Makali’i</notr>\n"
"\n"
"The direct translation means the “Bailer of *Makali’i*”. The lines are shaped as a canoe bailer which scoops *Ka Hei-Hei o Na Keiki* (Orion) and *Makali’i* (Pleiades) up into the night sky. In voyaging a bailer is used to scoop up water out of the hulls.\n"
"\n"
"The main stars of *Ke Ka o Makali’i* from North to South are *Hokulei* (Capella), *Nanamua* (Castor), *Nanahope* (Pollux), *Puana* (Procyon), and *‘A’a* (Sirius). These stars connect together to create the bailer in the sky. Mintaka (&delta; Ori) is an important star in this line because it rises/sets directly east or west giving the navigator an easy pointer star for direction. Mirzam (&beta; CMa next to *‘A’a* (Sirius)) and *Ke Ali’i Kona i Ka Lewa* (Canopus) connect together to create a southern pointer. *‘Ekekeuehuehu* (&theta; Aur, Mahasim) and *‘Ekekeu’ena’ena* (&beta; Aur, Menkalinan) connect to create a northern pointer. Different north/south pointers are found in the star lines and used heavily by navigators.\n"
"\n"
"### <notr>Ka Iwikuamo’o</notr>\n"
"\n"
"*Ka Iwikuamo’o* translates to the backbone (directly: Bone back-lizard). This star line is depicted as the backbone of a lizard or *mo’o* in this sky culture. It can also be representing a genealogical backbone, each star representing a generation.\n"
"\n"
"The star line itself starts with *Hokupa’a* (North Star), the ultimate northern pointer due to the star never moving in the sky, always above north. *Hokupa’a* connects down to *Na Hiku* (Big Dipper). *Na Hiku* translates to “The Seven” as there is seven stars in the Big Dipper. *Hokule’a* (Arcturus) and *Hikianalia* (Spica) are the two stars in the middle of the star line. The two PVS canoes are named after these two stars. *Hokule’a* is the “zenith” star of Hawai’i, meaning it will be directly overhead when you are at the latitude of the Hawaiian Islands. *Hokule’a* is very important to navigators on finding their way back to Hawai’i. The meaning of *Hokule’a* is “the star of gladness” because it is the star used to find home bringing joy. Next to *Hikianalia* is *Me’e*, a combination of four stars that create a box. *Me’e* connects down to *Hanaiakamalama* (Southern Cross) which is the southern pointer for *Ka Iwikuamo’o*.\n"
"\n"
"### <notr>Manaiakalani</notr>\n"
"\n"
"*Manaiakalani* translates to “The Chief's Fishline”. This refers to the legend of the demi god Maui and his fish hook. Maui is credited for pulling up the islands with his magical fish hook.\n"
"\n"
"This star line consists of two constellations. The Navigator’s Triangle on the north and Maui’s fish hook on the south. The Navigator’s Triangle is made of three stars *Hawaiki* (Deneb), *Keoe* (Vega), and *Humu* (Altair). (It is the same figure as the Summer Triangle for modern amateur astronomers.) These stars also represent the Polynesian triangle: Hawai’i (*Hawaiki*), Rapanui (*Keoe*), and Aotearoa (*Humu*). These three islands are pulled by the fish hook of Maui (Scorpius).\n"

"The northern pointer is found in the Navigator’s Triangle when you connect *Wainielela* (&epsilon; Cyg, Aljanah (Gienah)) and *Hawaiki* (Deneb). Southern pointers are in the fish hook when you connect *Mili’opu* (&delta; Sco, Dschubba) and *Kahe* (&pi; Sco, Fang), the stars on the top of the hook.\n"
"\n"
"### <notr>Ka Lupe o Kawelo</notr>\n"
"\n"
"*Ka Lupe o Kawelo* translates to “The Kite of Kawelo”. Kawelo was a great chief of Kaua’i and O’ahu and this star line represents the kite which was lost as a child.\n"
"\n"
"The star line starts with *‘Iwakeli’i*, meaning Chief Frigate Bird (*Fregata Minor*). The shape of this constellation (which is Cassiopeia's W in the West) resembles the *‘iwa* bird that is known for leading voyagers to land. The center of the star line is the Kite of Kawelo (equal to the Great Square of Pegasus). The four stars that make the kite are named after Kawelo’s greatest ancestors: *Manokalanipo* (&delta; Peg, Alpheratz), *Kakuhihewa* (&beta; Peg, Scheat), *Pi’ilani* (&gamma; Peg, Algenib), and *Keawe* (&alpha; Peg, Markab). All four were famous chiefs of their time. The star line then connects south to two stars *Pi’ikea* (&beta; Cet, Deneb Kaitos) and *Kukaniloko* (&alpha; PsA, Fomalhaut).\n"
"\n"
"The northern pointer is found in *Manokalanipo* (&delta; Peg, Alpheratz) and *Kealohalani-po-keao* (&beta; Cas, Caph) of *‘Iwakeli’i*. The southern pointer is connected with *Keawe* (&alpha; Peg, Markab) and *Kukaniloko* (&alpha; PsA, Fomalhaut)."

" The *master navigator* behind this sky culture was Mau Piailug of Satawal, who taught the Polynesian art of celestial navigation to Nainoa Thompson, who developed this version of the sky culture that was used from 2013-17 by Hawaiians to sail around the world during the Malama Honua Voyage of Hokule’a, the Polynesian voyaging canoe. Stellarium has been used as a tool by the navigators of Hokule’a and this sky culture serves as a tool for practicing Polynesian navigation.\n"

"### <notr>Rāśi (राशिः)</notr>\n"
"\n"
"The sidereal zodiac is an imaginary belt of 360 degrees (like the tropical zodiac), divided into 12 equal parts. Each twelfth part (of 30 degrees) is called a sign or rashi. Their names are shown in (brackets).\n"
"\n"
"In stellarium, we show Rāśi constellations attached to the corresponding asterisms, and not as divisions of the ecliptic offset away from their original locations to account for precession.\n"
"\n"
"In traditional astronomy there are two systems of measuring time - Lunar Calendar & Solar calendar. In both cases one year is divided into 12 months or \"māsā\". Name of the solar months originated from these constellation' names.\n"
"\n"
"### <notr>Nakṣatra (नक्षत्रम्)</notr>\n"
"\n"
"In Hindu tradition the ecliptic is divided into 27 parts of approximately 13°20', which correspond with 27 asterisms known as the nakṣatra-s (full list, with western equivalents here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra ). In the earliest extant layers of the tradition this number is 28. This division is critical for several purposes including timing rituals and determining the birth lunar mansions. Since these asterisms define an area in the sky, they are also technically constellations.\n"
"\n"
"sUrya-siddhAnta and vedAnga-jyotiSha specify start coordinates for the 13°20' divisions using some stars (Please see penultimate paragraph in [this page](https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfCalendarPanchangaCommittee/History-of-Calendar-Panchanga-Committee#page/n42/mode/1up))\n"
"\n"
"The earliest complete nakṣatra lists are found in the Taittirīya-śruti and the Atharvaveda where they are recited as part of the nakṣatreṣṭi ritual which places the deities of pantheon in these celestial compartments. Some scholars opine that the tradition shows that by the early medieval period, the nakṣatra identification had changed to a small degree from the Vedic period.\n"
"\n"
"There are multiple rich mythologies and symbolisms associated with the same constellations and stars (Example: [Raj Vedam on Rohini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq__DXtfeXw)) - it wouldn't do to rely on one to the exclusion of others during translation or truncated description. Hence we stick to etymological translations; and rather than including long mythological accounts here, just suggest that interested readers delve into them separately. (See references below.)\n"
"\n"
"Name of the lunar months originated from those 12 divisions' names in which full moon or \"Purnimā\" occurs. Unlike a solar day which defined by a sunrise to next sunrise, a lunar day or moon's position in a nakshatra doesn't depends on sun rising or moon rising. Thus a lunar day may start in any time of a solar day. Like other ancient human cultures, vedic people innovated a number of systems of which intercalary lunar months became most used, that is adding another month every 32.5 months on average or 4 months in every 11 years to correct the mismatch between lunar and solar year.\n"
"\n"
"A few of the yogatārā-s or prominent asterisms in the nakṣatra-s (going by their mainstream identification) lie slightly outside their constellation boundaries - in which case, any resultant problem (with regards to ritual timing or astrology) should be solved by other means (some people propose alternate identifications for such yogatārā-s).\n"
"\n"
"### Navagraha - Nine \"planets\"\n"
"\n"
"They observed that some celestial body moves independently relative to background stars and named them \"planets\" or \"graha\". As such The sun and moon are also treated as graha. They also named the lunar nodes as graha-s as these points are very important to calculate the eclipses. Name of vedic days originated from these planet's names.\n"

"Most astronomical observation in the Japan until the Meiji Restoration was "
"closely tied to astrological purposes. For ancient Chinese and later Korean "
"and Japanese cartographers four seasons and four cardinal directions is "
"marked as four talismanic animals - the Azure Dragon of the East (Spring), "
"the Red Bird of the South (Summer), the White Tiger of the West (Fall), and "
"the \"Genbu\" (Black Tortoise) of the North (Winter). Corresponding to each "
"of the talismanic animals the celestial \"palaces\" were seven *sei shuku* "
"or what are sometimes called \"lunar lodges\". The moon \"stations\" or "
"\"lodges\" probably may be used to determine position of sun and planets as "
"well as the moon, and their number may or may not have been related to the "
"period of the moon's orbit. Origins of these associations are obscure and "
"even controversial."
msgstr ""

#. Japanese Yasui Map sky culture description section in markdown format
msgid ""
"Determination of the talismanic animals and associated star \"palaces\" together with the associated 28 *sei shuku* or lunar lodges represent some of the most complex aspects of Asian \"astronomy\". An apparent anomaly is the fact that the actual positional path of the sun seems to move in a direction opposite the seasonal associations of Spring and Fall. Some scientists argues that this is due to the animals and sei shuku being created some 17 to 18 millennia ago (precession creating the anomaly), but it does not really explain the apparent \"backward\" motion of the sun through seasons.\n"
"\n"
"According to some scientists, the talismanic animals with their associated sei shuku were probably used in conjunction with the direction to which the handle of the big dipper (often called the \"North Seven Stars\" in China, Korea, and Japan) pointed at the equinoxes and solstices. Before the Christian Era, when the sei shuku were created, the big dipper did not appear to set, because they had a relatively \"higher\" position than now.\n"
"\n"
"Like myths and traditions in Western cultures, these views still wield influence in the daily life of people in China, Korea, and Japan (this despite quite prominent scientific literacy). However, it should be pointed out that astrological divination in China, Korea and Japan was and is rather complex.\n"
"\n"
"The lore related to moon stations is one of the most interesting aspects of Asian Ethnoastronomy. Japanese interpretations of these associations tended to revolve around agricultural needs and animistic views of nature. Unlike many Western myths and traditions, japanese gods in the similitude of the talismanic animals can be seen as manifestations of nature.\n"

"### Background\n"
"\n"
"This Stellarium Skyculture is the result of a Higher Degree Research project by Robert Fuller at Macquarie University, Sydney, finishing in 2014. Stellarium was chosen as a part of the project for Giving Back of the collected knowledge to the Kamilaroi and Euahlayi communities in the form of a documentary video (Star Stories of the Dreaming) and a student's Study Guide. Clips from the Stellarium were used in the documentary to illustrate certain sky objects."

"##### Gawaargay\n"
"\n"
"Gawaargay is the spirit Emu in the Sky, located with its head in the Coal Sack, and its neck and body stretching out through the dust lanes of the Milky Way (Warrambul) past Scorpius. The Euahlayi and the Kamilaroi see it with legs in April and May, when it is female and chasing the males. From June to August it is male and sitting on its nest without legs (the males brood the chicks), and this is a signal to collect the eggs. In the evening in late August it is vertical in the sky, and the head and body form two \"eggs\", meaning the eggs should not be collected. Later in the year, it appears on the horizon, so it is believed to be sitting in a waterhole, meaning the waterholes are full. When it is below the horizon, then it is on Earth as the Black Emu, which is rarely seen.\n"
"\n"
"##### Birringoloo\n"
"\n"
"Birringoloo is the second wife of Byaame, the creator/culture hero. She sits by the campfire of Byaame's camp (the star Alpha Muscae), and all women with girl children who die come to this camp before going on to Bulimah (Heaven behind Warrambul). They wait at this camp until all their girl children have died and come to the camp, and then they can proceed to Bulimah.\n"
"\n"
"##### Yarran\n"
"\n"
"Yarran (also called mingga) is the roots of the Yarran tree, an Acacia, which is the tree that Byaame took up to the Warrambul with the first man to die (and the Cockatoos). It is actually centred on the Coal Sack, and the dark nebula is the hollow of the tree seen from below, with the roots spreading around. When someone dies and goes to Bulimah, they go through the hollow of the Yarran.\n"
"\n"
"##### Old Wiringin\n"
"\n"
"A Wiringin is a \"Clever Man\" or Aboriginal doctor. This Wiringin located in the Small Magellanic Cloud is there because he controls who can go on to Bulimah. If the person who died is not initiated, they are not allowed, because they don't know the rules, so he sends them to Wadhaagudjaaylwan in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This birth spirit will send the uninitiated back to Earth as a new baby, so they can be initiated. This Wiringin is represented in every Aboriginal cemetery as the Wilga tree (Native Willow).\n"
"\n"
"##### Birray Birray\n"
"\n"
"The Birray Birray are a group of uninitiated boys who are in love with the seven young women (sisters), Miyay Miyay, who make up the Pleiades star cluster. They chased the Miyay Miyay, who ended up in the sky, and for this they were placed in Orion, as the three stars that make up the belt of Orion. Rigel is their fire, and the sword of Orion is their fire poker. They are kept from the Miyay Miyay by the Wiringin, Old Dthillar, who is Aldebaran.\n"
"\n"
"##### Miyay Miyay\n"
"\n"
"The Miyay Miyay are the seven young women (sisters) who were chased into the sky, depending on the story, by the Birray Birray, or by various Wiringins or other bad persons. They form the Pleiades star cluster, and as one sister is shy, normally we only see six stars. They are protected from the Birray Birray in Orion by the Wiringin, Old Dthillar, who is Aldebaran.\n"
"\n"
"##### Old Dthillar\n"
"\n"
"Old Dthillar is a Wiringin, in this case the Wiringin of the Birray Birray, the unitiated boys in Orion who pine for the Miyaay Miyaay (Seven Sisters) in the Pleiades. Old Dthillar is the star Aldebaran, which is also Alpha Tauri, and he stands there to protect the Miyaay Miyaay from the Birray Birray. The inverted \"V\" shape made up by Alpha, Epsilon, and Gamma Tauri is Old Dthillar's gunya (hut).\n"
"\n"
"##### Wamba Wamba\n"
"\n"
"\"Wamba\" means \"crazy\" or \"mad\". In this case, the star Canopus is called Wamba Wamba because of various reasons, depending on whose story is told. The planet Venus is also called Wamba. One speculation is that both Canopus and Venus are seen close to the horizon in the summer, and due to atmospheric defraction, can \"scintillate\" (twinkle srongly), which results in rapid changes in colour. This might be interpreted as madness.\n"
"\n"
"##### Wadhaagudjaaylwan\n"
"\n"
"Wadhaagudjaaylwan is Byaame's third wife, who is in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and sings to women who are going to have babies. She \"sings\" the babies to the women on Earth, and she takes the persons that the Old Wiringin in the Small Magellanic Cloud sends to her, and sends them back to Earth as babies.\n"
"\n"
"##### Bandaarr\n"
"\n"

"### Origin\n"
"\n"
"The 272 constellations displayed in this Stellarium sky culture are based on the Cheon-Sang-Yeol-Cha-Bun-Ya-Zi-Do, the Korean Constellation map, which was carved on the stone on 1395 but has its origin from another sky map which existed about 2,000 years ago. This map represents 1467 stars in about 190 constellations whose shapes are slightly different from the chinese ones. The interpretation of the map is not easy: the map is so old that only about 300 stars are found to match with the real stars. All the stars of the map were drawn on a circle, so the equator seems smaller than the southern limit. Because the density of constellation does not change with respect to the position, the position and the size of the constellations were somewhat altered in a way unknown by the author. It is assumed that there should be no bright stars which do not belong to any constellations. The work of the author is subject to interpretation, and could be changed at a later time. It will however roughly show what the Korean Constellation are like."

"### Lokono astronomical knowledge: an introduction\n"
"\n"
"From contemporary and historical accounts, it appears that astronomical knowledge was not restricted to particular members of the Lokono society. However, it was the medicine-men in particular&mdash;the spiritual leaders of the Lokono known as *semethi*&mdash;who were required to master the various aspects of star knowledge and who might have been responsible for passing the oral traditions associated with them from one generation to another. From Rodrigo de Navarette, who around 1550 wrote one of the first accounts of the Lokono, we learn, for instance, that:\n"
"\n"
"*&ldquo;old and wise men whom they call Cemetu assemble in the houses designed for their meetings and [&hellip;] recount the traditions and exploits of their ancestors and great men, and also narrate what those ancestors heard from their forefathers; so that in this manner they remember the most ancient events of their country and people. And, in like manner they recount or preach about events relating to the heavens, the sun, moon, and stars.&rdquo;*[#1]\n"
"\n"
"Navarette's *cemetu*, the medicine-men known in modern Lokono as *semethi*, have largely given up their practices today, which may be the reason why the transmission of astronomical knowledge has been interrupted. Many Lokono constellations appear to have been forgotten today. Our sources are therefore often limited to historical accounts written by early explorers and ethnographers of the Guianas, one of the oldest examples of which is illustrated below.\n"
" <p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <figure> <img src=\"illustrations/schulz.png\" width=\"572\" height=\"508\" align=\"middle\"/> <p style=\"text-align:center;\"><figcaption>Fig.1 List of Lokono stars by Theodor Schulz, circa 1803.[#23]</figcaption></p> </figure> </p>\n"
"It is this literature that allows us to party reconstruct the Lokono stellar knowledge, described below. Before discussing the individual celestial bodies, however, several general features of Lokono astronomy merit a mention, namely:\n"
"\n"
" - the overlap with the astronomical traditions of neighboring indigenous groups.\n"
" - the oral traditions explaining the origin and significance of celestial bodies.\n"
" - the use of the term *koya* &lsquo;spirit&rsquo; in the names of numerous constellations.\n"
" - the use of the general term *wiwa* &lsquo;star, year&rsquo; and the lack of other astronomical terms.\n"
" - the sky watching practices of the Lokono.\n"
"\n"
"### 1. Shared Guianan knowledge\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono territory borders that of two linguistically unrelated indigenous peoples, the Kari&rsquo;na, speaking a Cariban language, and the Warao, speaking a language isolate. Though unrelated and traditionally not intermarrying, the three groups share a great deal of material and immaterial culture. Ethnoastronomical tradition of the three peoples also shows a number of striking similarities, such as shared stellar myths, similar names of constellations, and parallels in the stellar calendar. This speaks to the contacts between the three groups and to the exchange of astronomical knowledge, possibly facilitated by their respective spiritual leaders, such as the Lokono *semethi*. The degree to which these traditions overlap and the directionality of their exchange require further study. Here, we focus on the Lokono and therefore do not discuss these cultural borrowings in detail, unless they shed light on the Lokono ethnoastronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### 2. Stellar oral traditions\n"
"\n"
"One of such shared features are myths about stars. Such oral traditions tell of the origins of particular celestial bodies, link them to one another, and explain their influence on the natural world. The Lokono constellation *Hithikoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the black curassow&rsquo;, for instance, is linked in a Lokono myth to that of *Yokhârhin* &lsquo;Hunter&rsquo; and *Al&ecirc;ti* &lsquo;Torch&rsquo;, all three of which have Kari&rsquo;na and Warao equivalents. It is these oral traditions, preserved by the medicine-men, that likely served as the main vehicle through which astronomical knowledge was passed from one generation to another. For this reason, summaries of the relevant myths are given in the description of particular constellations. Occasionally, when the relevant Lokono myth is not documented, myths of the neighboring groups are referred to in order to illuminate the significance of particular celestial bodies. Given that many of such oral traditions are shared by the Lokono and the neighboring groups, this enhancement of the poorly preserved Lokono astronomical knowledge is justified.\n"
"\n"
"### 3. Calendar of spirits\n"
"\n"
"The term *koya* &lsquo;spirit&rsquo;, found in numerous constellation names typically following a term for a particular plant or animal, is a key feature of Lokono astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, explains that such constellations are the spirits of the corresponding beings.[#4] At a time of the year when the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to earth to breathe life into the beings it represents. As such, the *koya*-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best time is to engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and animals (e.g. hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where such spirits would descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called these places with the same names as the constellations but the evidence of that remains poor. Thus, *Hadorhikoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the red acouchi&rsquo; would refer to the spirit, the constellation, and the place where the *hadorhi* is found in plenty when its constellation appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the *koya*-constellations remind us of the great understanding of the plant and animal life that the Lokono possessed.\n"
"\n"
"### 4. *Wiwa*, the star and the year\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono also have another general term that is used to refer to stars, *wiwa*. The term lacks the spiritual connotations of *koya.* It refers, on the one hand, to the physical quality of stars as something shining and, on the other hand, to the calendar year. As such, it is used, for instance, when talking about one&rsquo;s age. While it can apply to any star, *wiwa* appears only in two proper names of celestial bodies. *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa*, literally &lsquo;Scores of stars&rsquo; (Pleiades), is the most important of all Lokono constellations, whose appearance traditionally commences the Lokono calendar year. Following *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa* are the numerous *koya*-constellations, each signaling a different season in the Lokono calendar. On the other hand, *Wiwa kalemero*, literally &lsquo;Shining star&rsquo; (Jupiter) appears to have been singled out solely due to its brightness. Apart from *wiwa* and *koya*, there are no generic terms distinguishing planets, stars, moons, suns, galaxies and so on in the Lokono language. For this reason, the Lokono equivalent of the Milky Way, for instance, is included among other constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### 5. Sky watching practices\n"
"\n"
"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe the rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of the yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location to the Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location menu). It merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, did not connect the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was little agreement among speakers as to which star within a constellation corresponds to which parts of the plant or animal it represents. In Stellarium, we represent constellations with lines, but it should be kept in mind that this may be a distortion of the Lokono tradition, which allows for more flexibility in interpreting particular star groups. Finally, there are restrictions on looking at some celestial bodies, since it is believed that a spirit can harm one if looked at.[#5] For instance, by full moon, mothers covered the eyes of their children so that they would not become sick.[#6] Young people were also told not to look at *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa* (Pleiades), or else they would not grow.[#7] Such practices applied also to other objects believed to harbor powerful spirits and included other ways of avoiding eye-contact with spirits such rubbing peppers, limes, or salt into one&rsquo;s eyes.\n"
"\n"
"### Lokono celestial bodies\n"
"\n"
"##### *Hadali* 'Sun'\n"
"\n"
"The Lokono term for the Sun is *Hadali*, also pronounced as *Adali*. Claaudius de Goeje suggests that the variously spelled names of the Lokono culture hero, the first medicine-man known as *Harlitvanli*, *Haliwalika*, *Halwanli*, *Hariwalli*, and *Arawanili*, and sometimes *Arawidi,* may all refer to the same hero identified as the Sun.[#8] While we cannot confirm this hypothesis, the myth of *Arawidi* is worth mentioning. In the Lokono myth, *Arawidi*, the Sun, is the father of a man that becomes the constellation *Mabukuli* &lsquo;Man without a thigh&rsquo; (Orion&rsquo;s belt).[#9], [#10], [#11] According to the story, the Sun used to come to earth in the shape of a man called *Arawidi* to meet his lover with whom he had twins. In a later episode of the myth, one of the twins marries a woman, whose mother the couple decide to kill. When they try to escape, the wife&rsquo;s sister chases them and manages to cut off his leg in revenge. As a result, the man ascends to the sky and becomes the constellation *Mabukuli*. Another Lokono myth warns against offending the Sun: a man, stuck on an uninhabited island in the middle of a swamp, cries out for help. A boat passes him, but inside the boat is the Sun, which does not want to help the man, since people always complain that the Sun shines too hard.[#11]. As far as practices related to the Sun, Im Thurn reported that among the Lokono, the eclipse of the Sun was considered a war between *Hadali* and *Kathi*, the Moon, and that the Lokono would shout and make all kinds of noises to stop them from fighting.[#12]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Kathi* 'Moon'\n"
"\n"
"The moon is known as *Kathi*, a term first recorded by Joannes de Laet as *cattehee* around 1598, and used also to refer to the lunar month.[#13] According to the Lokono, the Moon, like the Sun, was once a man. Walter Roth reports a Lokono myth, in which a young woman was visited by a mysterious lover night after night.[#10] To find out who the lover was, the woman smeared her hands with the soot from the bottom of a pot. Next day, when she woke up, she found that her brother&rsquo;s face was covered in soot and realized it was him who visited her at night. Everybody in her community started to avoid the incestuous brother, who became so ashamed that he kept away from the people and ultimately ascended to the sky, becoming the Moon. This is why, according to the Lokono, the face of the moon is dirty today. The Moon appears also in another myth. In the Lokono myth about a man stuck on an uninhabited island mentioned above, another boat passes the man, but this time inside is the Moon, which decides to help the man, since people are always happy to see the Moon come out at night.[#11] The Moon and Sun are also depicted as opponents. In previous times, the Lokono believed that the eclipse of the Moon is its death (*kathi &ocirc;don* &lsquo;moon dying&rsquo;) and would keep watch all night.[#6] The Lokono say during the eclipse of the Moon that the Moon has fallen asleep on the Sun&rsquo;s path.[#11] Therefore, they make a lot of noise, play drums, and blow shell trumpets to wake him up. By full moon, mothers would cover the eyes of their children so that they do not become sick.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Warhokoma* 'Venus'\n"
"\n"
"The planet Venus, both when it appears in the morning as the Morning Star and when it appears in the evening as the Evening Star, is called *Warhokoma* by the Lokono.[#8], [#14], [#15] Charles Dance, on the other hand, reports the terms *Eweiwah* and *Huewah*, probably the equivalents of the general term *wiwa* &lsquo;star&rsquo; which can be used for any shining celestial body.[#16] The Lokono also speak of Venus as *Hiyaro wiwa* &lsquo;women&rsquo;s star&rsquo;. In relation to this, it merits a mention that Claudius de Goeje reports that when *Hiyaro wiwa* appears close to the Moon, and a girl is about to have her first menstruation, the Lokono say that the girl will soon be touched by the Moon.[#5] There is no myth about *Warhokoma* specifically and its relation to the Moon, but it is worth reminding that the Lokono know a story, in which the Moon was originally a man who committed incest with his sister (see the myth mentioned under *Kathi*), and has a name as a womanizer.[#10] Interestingly, the name *Warhokoma* for Morning or Evening Star appears also in Kari&rsquo;na, who see it also as the Moon's wife.[#17], [#18]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Waya nukuthi bunaha* 'Milky Way'\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is known among the Lokono as *Waya nukuthi bunaha,* literally &lsquo;Path of the carriers of clay&rsquo;. The Milky Way represents the footprints of men who once went to fetch clay for making pots, an art that is, rarely if at all, practiced by the Lokono today. The origin of the name, however, is still known, and is summarized in a myth.[#19] The same name for Milky Way was noted by William Brett who adds that it is named after a specific whitish type of clay.[#14] Charles Dance, on the other hand, says that the Milky Way represents the footprints of peccaries rooting up the clay, while Walter Roth mentions a different Lokono explanation, according to which the Milky way represents a tapir chased by a dog and jaguar.[#10], [#16] However, these two sources do not give the corresponding Lokono name for the Milky Way, and it is possible that these two explanations are a Kari&rsquo;na influence, who recognize a constellation of a tiger following the constellation of a tapir within that of the Milky Way.[#17]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Mali* 'Sirius'\n"
"\n"
"The modern Lokono call Sirius *Mali*, the literal meaning of which is unknown. Cornelius van Coll describes a Lokono star called *Mali* and explains that it is a very powerful star.[#7], [#17] When it comes up in the morning in August, it kills the fish in the swamps, and one should not point at it or one&rsquo;s finger will become lame. Cornelius van Coll&rsquo;s *Mali* marks the beginning of the big dry season (August to December), called in Lokono *malidalithe*, a term derived from *Mali*. Older sources identified *Mali* tentatively as Lyra, Aquila, or Crux, but given that the big dry season starts around August and that the Lokono observe the stars in the morning, these identifications must be incorrect; Lyra, Aquila, and Crux cannot be seen at this time from the Lokono territories.[#11], [#17] There are no Lokono myths about *Mali*, but there is evidence that is may correspond to the Kari&rsquo;na constellation *Ombatapo* &lsquo;Previous face&rsquo;. The Kari&rsquo;na myths explain the origin of the constellation and its name, which, like the Lokono *Mali*, is believed to kill the fish in the swamps and announces the beginning of the big dry season. Moreover, the Kari&rsquo;na *Ombatapo* is identified as parts of Puppis and Canis Major, the latter of which includes Sirius.[#18], [#20]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Yôkoro wiwa* 'Scores of stars'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa* or *Wiwa y&ocirc;koro*, literally &lsquo;Score of stars&rsquo;, refers to the Pleiades and is easily recognized by the contemporary Lokono. This is likely because *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa* is described as the most important of Lokono constellations, since it announce the beginning of the Lokono year.[#17] After it comes out first in June in the east, it is followed by the numerous *koya*-constellations referring to the spirits of animals and plants that constitute the Lokono calendar. At that time of the year, the Lokono say *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa kayaran* &lsquo;the birth of *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa*&rsquo;. It is said that if *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa* shines strong when it appears for the first time, many people will die in the coming year.[#5] Cornelius van Coll also warns that young people should not look at it, or else they will not grow.[#7] These omens and warnings are related to a Lokono myth. According to the story, there were once twin brothers, one of which had a wife, and said that death would come when their star, *Y&ocirc;koro Wiwa*, rises.[#7] Death came indeed, killing even his wife, roasting her on the fire, and the Lokono became angry and brought a giant green anaconda to swallow the twins. The snake ate one of the brothers, but because it was already 5 am and the day broke, the snake could not eat the other brother. The snake is now the constellation *Kamodokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the green anaconda&rsquo;, in the belly of which *Y&ocirc;koro Wiwa* is said to be located (see also the *Yorhada* myth). In another narrative, the Lokono explain that the *Y&ocirc;koro Wiwa* represents seven brothers lost in a savannah on their way back home, a motif also known from a Kari&rsquo;na story.[#20]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Yorhada* 'Grill'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Yorhada* &lsquo;Grill&rsquo;, or *Wiwa yorhadale* &lsquo;Star&rsquo;s grill&rsquo;, represents a wooden grill, on which meat is roasted.[#4], [#11], [#21] Its origin is explained in a myth related by Walter Roth about a man who killed his wife, roasted her, and fed her liver to his mother-in-law because she called him a worthless hunter.[#10] In revenge, the mother asked her brother, *Kamodo* to kill the man when he went hunting. The man suspected the woman set a trap and escaped death by sending his brother instead. The grill on which the wife was roasted became the Western constellation Pegasus, according to contemporary Lokono, marking the beginning of the small dry season (April), the time when the Lokono roast a lot of fish. The myth is similar to that of *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa* and the twins, in which the older brother is responsible for roasting his wife and may be the same as the man who roasted his wife in the *Yorhada* myth. In both myths, the younger brother killed by the anaconda becomes *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa*, while the grill becomes *Yorhada*. Claudius de Goeje suggested that *Yorhada* is the Western constellation Corvus, but Corvus does not appear at beginning of the small dry season.[#11] The neighboring Warao also know Pegasus as the grill, and are familiar with the myth.[#10]\n"

"##### *Kamodokoya* 'Spirit of the green anaconda'\n"
"\n"
"*The constellation Kamodokoya*, &lsquo;Spirit of the green anaconda (*Eunectes murinus*)', also called *Waroboshi* remains poorly described.[#5] Older sources suggest it is Perseus, Pleiades, Scorpio, or Ophiuchus, but the exact stars remain unidentified.[#10], [#11], [#21] Several myths explain its origin. According to Walter Roth, a man killed his wife, roasted her, and fed her liver to her mother because she called him a worthless hunter.[#10], In revenge, she asked *Kamodo* to kill him, but the man escaped the snake who ate his younger brother instead. The constellation *Kamodokoya* has *Y&ocirc;koro wiwa*, the brother, inside, and is close to *Yorhada* &lsquo;Grill&rsquo;, on which the wife was roasted. Notably, Theodor Schultz list the constellation *Waroboshi yorhadale* 'The grill of the green anaconda' which could be the same as the constellation *Yorhada*.[#23] Cornelius van Coll speaks of twins, one of whom had a wife, and warned that their star brings death.[#7] Indeed, even his wife died, roasted on the fire. The Lokono had the snake kill the man, and ascend to the sky as *Kamodokoya*. Finally, Claudius de Goeje relates a myth of a woman who felt a desire for men, and put a *katuburi* flower in her vagina, and became pregnant. Her child was partly a snake, and people wanted to kill it, so it ascended to the sky.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Kibiwarhakoya*  'Spirit of the capybara'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Kibiwarhakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the capybara&rsquo; (*Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris*) was mentioned by the Penard brothers.[#17] The same source also informs us that it is followed by the constellation *Kamodokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the green anaconda&rsquo;. The constellation remains unidentified and its significance is unknown. No related myths have been documented.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Mabukuli* 'Man without a thigh'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Mabukuli* &lsquo;Man without a thigh&rsquo; is well known among the Lokono and appears in a few myths. According to Charles Dance, an unsuccessful huntsman cut off his own leg, wrapped it up in a leaf, and gave to his step mother so that she had something to eat, and ascended to sky.[#16] Similarly, the Penard brothers speak of an unsuccessful hunter who cut off his leg and gave it to his wife and mother-in-law, telling them it was tapir meat.[#17] He then asked other people to follow his traces to help him bring the rest of the tapir, but when they arrived at the place they only found the *akalali* plant with which he treated his wounds. His body turned into the *Kama t&acirc;la* constellation and his spirit into *Mabukuli*. Claudius de Goeje relates a strikingly different myth.[#11] The Sun, once a man called *Arawidi* (see the myth about *Hadali* 'Sun'), took a woman as his wife, who followed him with unborn twins inside her. One day, she lost the way and ended up being eaten by vulture spirits, but her twins were brought up by an old woman, whom they later killed and ran away. While hiding in a treetop, they saw a woman catching fish with a sifter. She saw their reflection in the water and tried to catch it, at which they laughed. She then realized they were up in the tree, and sent ants up the tree to make them come down. When they came down, she killed one of them and took the other home. One of her daughters fell in love with the man and married him. Now the husband had to catch a lot of fish every day for the mother-in-law. One day, tired of his demanding mother-in-law, he tricked her into getting into the water to help him unload a boat full of fish, where she was eaten by a shark. When her other daughter arrived, the liver of her mother was still floating on the water and told her that the man killed her. The daughter wanted to kill him but he flew away on wings of cotton that his wife made for him, so she only cut his thigh off, which is why he is now the constellation *Mabukuli*. It appears the Orion's belt represents the cut-off leg, not the man himself.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Kama tâla* 'Jaw of the tapir'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Kama t&acirc;la* &lsquo;Jaw of the tapir&rsquo; is one of the few constellations identified easily by the contemporary Lokono, just like *Mabukuli*, to which it is related in a myth.[#8], [#15] The Penard brothers recount the story of an unsuccessful hunter, who cuts meat off his leg and gives it to his wife and mother-in-law, telling them it is tapir meat (*Tapirus terrestris*).[#17] He then asks his fellow people to follow him and help bring the rest of the tapir, but when they arrive at the place they only find the *akalali* plant with which he treated his wounds. His body turned into *Kama t&acirc;la* and his spirit into *Mabukuli*. In a Kari&rsquo;na story, on the other hand, *Kama t&acirc;la* was the remains of a tapir that the mythical twins were hunting, one of whom accidentally gets his leg severed and becomes the constellation of man without a thigh.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Hithikoya* 'Spirit of the black curassow'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Hithikoya* is the &lsquo;Spirit of the black curassow&rsquo; (*Crax alector*), a commonly hunted bird, often kept as a pet for its feathers and eggs. According to a Lokono myth, *Hithikoya* lived on earth, but the Lokono kept shooting him.[#11] As a result, he ascended to the sky to warn black curassows about the approaching hunter (see *Yokh&acirc;rhin*) and his companion with a torch (see *Al&ecirc;ti*). The Lokono identify *Hithikoya* as the Western constellation Crux. When it appears just above the trees in January, the curassows roam on the ground and are easy to catch. Over the following months, the higher *Hithikoya* rises in the morning, the higher the birds climb up the trees. By March, it appears high in the sky and the birds are found in the tops of the trees. *Hithikoya* thus informs the Lokono where to search for the birds at a given time of the year. The Lokono even make hunting charms (*bina*) from a plant, whose leaves resemble the bird, rubbed into the lips of the hunter so that he can imitate the calls of the bird, increasing his chances of catching one.[#10], [#17]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Yokhârhin* 'Hunter'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Yokh&acirc;rhin* &lsquo;Hunter&rsquo; corresponds to &alpha; Centauri and represents the man hunting *Hithikoya*, the &lsquo;Spirit of the black curassow&rsquo; (see *Hithikoya*).[#9], [#10], [#11] His companion holding a torch known as *Al&ecirc;ti* is represented by &beta; Centauri. The myth reported by the Penard brothers that explains the origin of *Hithikoya* includes also these two characters.[#11] According to the story, *Hithikoya* used to live on earth, but the Lokono kept tracking him down at night and shoot him. As a result, it ascended to the sky to serve as a signal for black curassows warning them about the approaching hunter (*Yokh&acirc;rhin*) and his companion with a torch (*Al&ecirc;ti*). As *Hithikoya* appears higher and higher in the morning between January and March, *Yokh&acirc;rhin* and subsequently *Al&ecirc;ti* appear on the horizon following it. This indicates to the Lokono that the black curassow can now be found high in the tress and the hunters can set out at night to hunt it in the tree tops.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Alêti* 'Torch'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation&nbsp;*Al&ecirc;ti* &lsquo;Torch&rsquo; corresponds to&nbsp;&beta; Centauri and represents the companion of the hunter *Yokh&acirc;rhin*, holding a torch made from a piece of cloth dipped in beeswax known as *Al&ecirc;ti*.[#9], [#10], [#11]&nbsp; *Al&ecirc;ti* follows *Yokh&acirc;rhin* so as not to scare the black curassow bird with the light of the torch. The myth reported by the Penard brothers that explains the origin of *Hithikoya* 'Spirit of the black curassow' includes also these two characters (see *Hithikoya*).[#11] According to the story, *Hithikoya* used to live on earth, but the Lokono kept tracking him down at night and shoot him. As a result, it ascended to the sky to serve as a signal for black curassows warning them about the approaching hunter (*Yokh&acirc;rhin*) and his companion with a torch (*Al&ecirc;ti*). As *Hithikoya* appears higher and higher in the morning between January and March, *Yokh&acirc;rhin* and subsequently *Al&ecirc;ti* appear on the horizon following it. This indicates to the Lokono that the black curassow can now be found high in the tress and the hunters can set out at night to hunt it in the tree tops.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Anorhâkoya* 'Spirit of the cocoi heron'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Anorh&acirc;koya* represents the spirit of the cocoi heron (*Ardea cocoi*). It is recognized by contemporary Lokono as Ursa Major, in keeping with earlier identifications.[#11], [#15] Claudius de Geoje reports that when it shines strong, the Lokono believe that strong winds will come, bringing dust into peoples&rsquo; eyes and consequently diseases: the heron picks their eyes with its beak, it is said.[#11] Similarly, according to Cornelius van Coll, *Anorh&acirc;koya* is a heron whose beak is upside down. Should its beak be turned downwards, people would get all kinds of eye diseases.[#7] This can still happen when strong winds blow and carry the light from the beak into peoples&rsquo; eyes, since the light of *Anorh&acirc;koya* (and other stars) travels with the wind according to the Lokono. The constellation is associated with the big dry season (August to December) and the storms and winds that are typical of this time. It appears in the morning in mid-November in the northeast with its beak down.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Honolikoya* 'Spirit of the rufescent tiger heron'\n"
"\n"
"Another Lokono constellation named after a species of a heron is *Honolikoya* &lsquo;*Spirit of the rufescent tiger heron*&rsquo; (*Tigrisoma lineatum*). It is reported in historical sources as the equivalent of the Kari&rsquo;na constellation *Kumawari yumï* (&lsquo;Father of the cocoi heron&rsquo;). This is likely a mistake as *honoli* is a different and well-known species of a heron. It is possible that *Honolikoya* refers to the same constellation as *Anorhâkoya*, interpreted differently by different Lokono consultants, but it is also possible it is a different constellation. In any case, *Honolikoya* remains unidentified.[#17] Just like *Anorh&acirc;koya*, the constellation is said to bring diseases of the eyes when it appears in the morning sky. From the Penard brothers' description we can infer that *Honolikoya* should appear between June and the big dry season, which lasts from end of August until the beginning of December. There appears to be no specific myth associated with this constellation.[#17]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Kasorhowakoya* 'Spirit of the four-eyed fish'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Kasorhowakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the four-eyed fish&rsquo; (*Anableps anableps*) was identified by the contemporary Lokono as &lambda; Scorpii and &upsilon; Scorpii. In earlier sources it is identified as the upper part of Scorpio&rsquo;s tail, which is in keeping with the 21st century data.[#8] The constellation represents the two eyes of the four-eyed fish, which is known for the fact that its eyes are always sticking above the water, and is therefore sometimes considered an incarnation of the water spirit. There is no Lokono myth concerning the four-eyed fish, and it remains unknown what the appearance of this constellation signifies. However, it merits a mention that the Kari&rsquo;na have a constellation representing the same fish, which corresponds to the same two stars. Maga&ntilde;a and Jara explain that the appearance of the Kari&rsquo;na constellation announces the fishing season for this species.[#18] It is not unlikely that the Lokono constellation had the same function.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Katarhokoya* 'Spirit of the green sea turtle'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Katarhokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the green sea turtle&rsquo; is still known on the Pomeroon River in Guyana. It represents the *katarho* turtle (*Chelonia mydas*), swimming towards the shore, represented in turn by the Milky Way. When the constellation appears in the morning high in the sky, it is a signal that turtles are arriving on the beaches to lay eggs. The constellation was identified in earlier sources as *Corona Borealis* and *Orion's belt.* [#8], [#11] While the former overlaps with the stars indicated by the Lokono on the Pomeroon, the latter is likely a mistake as *Orion&rsquo;s belt* is consistently recognized as *Mabukuli* &lsquo;Man without a thigh&rsquo;. The constellation *Katarhokoya* rises early in the year, but it appears upside down most of the time from the vistas of the Lokono in the Guianas. Only by mid-March, a time when several species of turtles indeed lay their eggs on the Atlantic coast of the Guianas, does it look like a turtle swimming to the shore (Milky Way).\n"
"\n"
"##### *Hikorhikoya* 'Spirit of the yellow-footed tortoise'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Hikorhikoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the yellow-footed tortoise&rsquo; was documented by the Penard brothers for the Lokono in Suriname; it remains unidentified but it should appear around August (i.e. around the beginning of the big dry season).[#11], [#17] The Penard brothers explain that when the water in the swamps rises, the yellow-footed tortoise, known in Lokono as *hikorhi* (*Chelonoidis denticulatus*), seeks higher grounds, and, presumably, can be more easily found. There are no myths related to the constellation specifically. However, it is worth pointing out that the tortoise is considered a delicacy among the Lokono. When caught, they are often kept around the house in small corrals for long periods of time until they are consumed. The Lokono joke that they are &lsquo;fridges&rsquo; since if fed, the tortoise will stay alive for a long time, as opposed to an animal that was shot and has to be prepared and eaten immediately.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Kwakoya* 'Spirit of the blue crab'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Kwakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the blue crab&rsquo; is still known in the Lokono communities closer to the coast, which practice the annual crab feats. The crab species is likely the same as that represented by the Kari&rsquo;na constellation *Kusa yumï* &lsquo;Father of the blue crab&rsquo; (*Ucides cordatus*). The constellation appears in the east in the middle of July. By the beginning of August, it is high in the sky, signaling that the crabs arrive at the beaches to lay their eggs. At this time, the Lokono and other indigenous groups of the area congregate to the shore of the Atlantic to catch the marching crabs. The crabs are considered a delicacy and when the villagers return to the communities with the catch, large feasts are organized during which the crabs are eaten. The Penard brothers write that *Kwakoya* appears when the crabs come to lay their eggs in May and June but this appears to be incorrect, both given that crabs march later and that the constellation recognized by the modern Lokono is not visible in May and June from the Guianas.[#17]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Ifakoya* 'Spirit of the Muscovy duck'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Ifakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the Muscovy duck&rsquo; (*Cairina moschata*) was mentioned by the Penard brothers and Claudius de Goeje but remained unidentified until now.[#11], [#17] The contemporary Lokono on the Pomeroon River in Guyana recognize it in parts of the Western constellation Corona Australis. There are no myths related to this constellation but the Lokono say that when the head of the duck points toward the ground, looking as if the duck has its head under the water, the ducks are busy feeding on plants. The constellation assumes this position from mid-May. At this time, it is said that the birds are easier to catch. The Muscovy duck is considered a delicacy and is also often kept around the house like chickens. The Kari&rsquo;na and the Warao also recognize the constellation of the Muscovy duck, and at least the Warao one corresponds to the same stars.[#17]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Awarhakoya* 'Spirit of the awara palm'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Awarhakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the awara palm&rsquo; has the shape of an awara palm (*Astrocaryum vulgare*). Its appearance high in the sky in January means that awara fruits are ripening. In the following months, *Awarhakoya* moves closer to the horizon, meaning that the fruits will soon fall to the ground to be picked. This occurs in the small dry season (mid-February to April), known as *awarhadlithe*, a term derived from the name of the palm.[#7], [#17] There are no myths about *Awarhakoya* but it is said that the constellation is followed by that of the *Hadorhikoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the red acouchi&rsquo; and *Hokorherokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the red-rumped agouti&rsquo;. Their appearance signals that the rodents are gathering by the palms to eat the fallen fruit. *Awarhakoya* is recognized today in stars close to the Western constellation Coma Berenices, but older sources suggest it is near Sirius.[#11] It is the only constellation named after a plant, which speaks to the importance of the awara palm to the Lokono. The Kari&rsquo;na also have a constellation of the awara, sometimes recognized in the same stars.[#17], [#20]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Hadorhikoya* 'Spirit of the red acouchi'\n"
"\n"
"The unidentified constellation *Hadorhikoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the red acouchi&rsquo; (*Myoprocta acouchy*) was mentioned by the Penard brothers.[#17] It should follow the constellation *Awarhakoya* appearing near it sometime after February. Its appearance signals that the ripe fruits of the palm attract the red acouchi to the awara grooves, where they can be hunted. There is no Lokono myth about *Hadorhikoya*, but a Kari&rsquo;na myth about the unidentified Kari&rsquo;na constellation of the red acouchi relates it to the several other constellations. According to the story, there were two brothers, of which one had a wife. The unmarried brother killed his brother, fed his liver to the wife, took her as his wife, and had a child with her. The spirit of the dead brother told the woman that his brother killed him, so she and her child decided to run away and ascend to the sky as the constellation of the agouti and acouchi. The spirit also told his brother to cut open his corpse and scatter his insides, which became the Pleiades, while the killer became the constellation of the anaconda.[#11]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Hakorherokoya* 'Spirit of the red-rumped agouti'\n"
"\n"
"The unidentified constellation *Hokorherokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the red-rumped agouti&rsquo; was mentioned by the Penard brothers, who explain that like *Hadorhikoya*, it follows *Awarhakoya*.[#17] It signals that the ripe fruit attracts the agouti (*Dasyprocta leporina*) to the awara palms, where they can be hunted. Claudius de Goeje adds that it is followed by *Kabadarokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the tiger&rsquo;, which, like humans, knows agouti's habits.[#11] There is no Lokono myth about *Hokorherokoya*, but a Kari&rsquo;na myth about the unidentified constellation of the agouti explains its origin. According to the story, there were two brothers, one married, the other not. The unmarried one killed the other, fed his liver to the wife, took her as his wife, and had a child with her. The dead brother's spirit told her that his brother killed him, so she and her child ran away, becoming the agouti and acouchi constellations. The spirit then told his brother to open his corpse and scatter his insides, which became the Pleiades, while the killer became the anaconda constellation.[#11]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Kabadarokoya* 'Spirit of the jaguar'\n"
"\n"
"*Kabadarokoya* or *Arhwakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the jaguar&rsquo; was mentioned by the Penard brothers, who link it to a Lokono myth.[#7], [#11] According to the story, *Kabadaro* (*Panthera onca*) was the father of *Korhirhwathe* (*Leopardus species*), whom he loved so much, he did not want to marry her out.[#33] One day a thorn got stuck in his paw and a man helped him take it out, so he gave the man his daughter as his wife. The family always had meat, so other people were jealous and told the man that his wife cheated on him. He started mistreating her. When the jaguar learned about this, he ran away with his daughter but the man followed them everywhere, so finally they ascended to the sky. But when the Lokono kill a jaguar, they can come back to earth to kill people. According to Claudius de Goeje, it follows the agouti star, a delicacy of the jaguars.[#11] The constellation is unidentified. The Kari&rsquo;na constellation of the jaguar is said to appear around the small dry season, when jaguars roar more because they suffer from insects.[#17], [#20]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Korhirhwathekoya* 'Spirit of the ocelot'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Korhirhwathe* &lsquo;Spirit of the ocelot&rsquo; was mentioned by the Penard brothers, who link it to the same Lokono myth summarized above for *Kabadarokoya*.[#11] According to the story, *Kabadaro* (*Panthera onca*) was the father of *Korhirhwathe* (*Leopardus species*), whom he loved so much, he did not want to marry her out. However, one day a thorn got stuck in his paw and a man helped him take it out, so he gave the man his daughter as his wife. The family always had plenty of meat, so other people became jealous and told the man that his wife cheated on him. As a result, he started mistreating *Korhirhwathe*. When the jaguar learned about this, he took his daughter, and ran away with her into the forest, but the man followed them everywhere, so finally they ascended to the sky becoming constellations. Now, when the Lokono kill a jaguar, they can come back to earth to kill people.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Hawkoya* 'Spirit of the pale-throated sloth'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Hawkoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the pale-throated sloth&rsquo; was mentioned by Claudius de Goeje.[#11] It represents a species of a sloth (*Bradypus tridactylus*) and is an omen of storms and windy weather that occur at the beginning of the big dry season (between August and December). At this time, the sloths start to wander about more, and the Lokono say that it is because of the winds.[#17] The constellation remains unidentified.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Warhemedokoya*  'Spirit of the two-toed sloth'\n"
"\n"
"Similarly, *Warhemedokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the two-toed sloth&rsquo;, mentioned by the Penard brothers, is said to appear when the storms and winds of the big dry season are about to start and make the sloths move about more.[#17] It represents the two-toed sloth (*Choloepus didactylus*). The constellation remains unidentified.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Yôwanakoya*  'Spirit of the green iguana'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Y&ocirc;wanakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the green iguana&rsquo; is mentioned by the Penard brothers.[#17] It represents the green iguana (*Iguana iguana*) and appears when the iguanas lay their eggs in the sand, which should be sometime in April and May, but the constellation remains unidentified.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Yarheyarherokoya*  'Spirit of the lilac-tailed parrot'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Yarheyarherokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the lilac-tailed parrot&rsquo; (*Touit batavicus*) was mentioned by Claudius de Goeje.[#11] The constellation is not known to contemporary Lokono; neither do we know what its appearance used to signify.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Marodikoya*  'Spirit of the marail guan'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Marodikoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the marail guan&rsquo; was mentioned by Claudius de Goeje, who comments that it has the shape of the marail guan (*Penelope marail*).[#11] The constellation is not known to contemporary Lokono; neither do we know what its appearance used to signify.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Hikarowanakoya*  'Spirit of the little cuckoo'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Hikarowanakoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the little cuckoo&rsquo; was only mentioned by Claudius de Goeje.[#11] It represents the little cuckoo (*Coccycua minuta*). The constellation remains unidentified; neither do we know what its appearance used to signify. However, the Penard brothers mention the Kari&rsquo;na constellation of a cuckoo species identified as the very similar *Piaya cayana*.[#17], [#22] The Kari&rsquo;na constellation is said to bring luck to hunters. Interestingly, the Lokono link hunter&rsquo;s luck to the little cuckoo as well. They say that if the bird passes you calling *pikwan pikwan pikwan*, you have to watch out, as something bad might happen to you.\n"
"\n"
"##### *S&ucirc;tukoya*  'Spirit of the red-handed tamarin'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *S&ucirc;tukoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the red-handed tamarin&rsquo; (*Saguinus midas*) was mentioned by Cornelius van Coll and the Penard brothers but it remains poorly identified.[#7], [#11], [#43] According to Claudius de Goeje, it should correspond to the Western constellation Coma Berenices.[#17] It is not clear whether this is correct, however, given that today we find the constellation *Awarhakoya* in this part of the sky, which is easily recognized by numerous speakers. There are no myths related to this constellation.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Howakoya*  'Spirit of the white-faced saki'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Howakoya* 'Spirit of the white-faced saki&rsquo; was only mentioned by de Claudius de Goeje.[#17] It represents the spirit of white-faced saki (*Pithecia pithecia*) but the constellation and its significance remain unknown.[#44]\n"
"\n"
"##### *Imenarikoya*  'Spirit of the scorpion'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Imenarikoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the scorpion&rsquo; was only mentioned by Claudius de Goeje.[#11] The constellation refers to a spirit of an unidentified species of a large poisonous scorpion. There are no known myths about *Imenarikoya*. The constellation could be a case of cultural borrowing from non-indigenous populations, as has been suggested for the Kari&rsquo;na constellation representing a scorpion.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Maraka*  'Rattle of the medicine-man'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation  *Maraka*  'Rattle of the medicine-man' was mentioned by Claudius de Goeje, and refers to a rattle used by the Lokono medicine-men, which is made of a calabash pierced with a stick, adorned with feathers of a certain parrot, and filled with numerous small crystals, each of which harbors a different spirit, that is a different type of *koya*.[#11] The constellation remains unidentified; there is no Kari&rsquo;na or Warao equivalent and there are no myths related to it.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Shimarhabokoya*  'Spirit of the bow and arrow' and  *Arakabosakoya*  'Spirit of the gun'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Shimarhabokoya* ‘Spirit of the bow and arrow’ and *Arakabosakoya* ‘Spirit of the gun’ were mentioned by Claudius de Goeje.[#11] Both constellations remain unidentified and do not have Kari&rsquo;na and Warao counterparts, and there are no myths related to them.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Korherokoya*  'Spirit of the parrot'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation&nbsp;*Korherokoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the parrot&rsquo; was only mentioned by Claudius de Goeje.[#11] The constellation refers to a spirit of an unidentified species of a parrot, but it was mentioned as the equivalent of the Kari&rsquo;na constellation *Kurewako yumï* ‘Father of the orange-winged parrot’, representing the orange-winged parrot (*Amazona amazonica*). There are no known myths about *Korherokoya*. It should appear in February when the parrots are big enough to be taken out of their nests, but the constellation remains unidentified.\n"
"\n"
"##### *Kasipenikoya*  'Spirit of the sea turtle'\n"
"\n"
"The constellation *Kasipenikoya* &lsquo;Spirit of the sea turtle&rsquo; was mentioned by Claudius de Goeje.[#11] It refers to the spirit of an unidentified species of a turtle. It may be the case that it is the same as *Katarokoya*. The term *kataro* (*Chelonia mydas*) appears to be a term borrowed from Kari&rsquo;na, it is thus possible that *kasipeni* is the original Lokono term for the same turtle. However, there are several species of turtles in the Guianas, thus *kataro* and *kasipeni* can also refer to different species, and their spirits be identified with different constellations."

"Ethnoastronomical research among Macedonian people began in 1982, organized "
"by the Planetarium at Youth Cultural Centre. In the past years, around 140 "
"villages in Republic of Macedonia have been visited and over 1500 "
"inhabitants have been interviewed and surveyed. All collected information "
"from the population have been published in the book “Sky over Macedonia” "
"(Cenev G, 2004). An integral part of this book is the Sky map of Macedonian "
"people which has been reconstructed based on the descriptions of "
"constellations known to elderly inhabitants of Macedonian villages (Cenev "
"G., 2000)."

#. Macedonian sky culture constellations section in markdown format
msgid ""
"##### Mother Hen (Kvachka) *[Quatʃka]*\n"
"\n"
"is the best-known constellation, which is recognized by all elderly people in Macedonian villages, without any exception. This name people use for the star cluster Pleiades\n"
"\n"
"##### Rooster (Petal) *[Petel]*\n"
"\n"
"This is the name of the star Alnath (or Elnath) from the constellation Taurus.\n"
"\n"
"##### Hawk (Јastreb) *[Yastreb]*\n"
"\n"
"Hawk, as one of the most famous enemies of the Mother Hen and the Rooster, is right above them in an attacking position. Bright star Capella (Kapela) from the constellation Auriga is actually known among people as Hawk.\n"
"\n"
"##### Fox (Lisica) *[Lysitsa]*\n"
"\n"
" Fox is the second by importance natural enemy of the Mother Hen and the Rooster so it is obvious why people also “see” it on the sky. The red color of the bright star Aldebaran from the constellation of the Bull is the reason why people perceive it as a Fox ready to attack the Mother Hen and the Rooster.\n"
"\n"
"##### Pigs (Svinji) *[Sviƞi]*\n"
"\n"
"Near to the Mother Hen, people on the sky noticed the star cluster Hyades. Scattered appearance of the stars of this cluster associated people to the image of pigs in a village yard, and so it’s called Pigs.\n"
"\n"
"##### Yoke (Jarem) *[Yarem]*\n"
"\n"
"People under this name recognize group of stars in the constellation Perseus. Yokes for the oxen usually is found in village yards so that is why, like the previous constellation, is evidence of the general image of people and purpose given to this part of the sky.\n"
"\n"
"##### Ploughman (Orach) *[Oratʃ]*\n"
"\n"
"The Ploughman is one of the three main characters in the sky. It is the name people gave to the bright star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion. Besides Betelgeuse, in building the image of this folk constellation, some weaker and less bright stars from the surrounding are also taken into account, because people say that the Ploughman is an image of a person with a goad as he returns home.\n"
"\n"
"##### Plough with Oxen (Ralo so Volovi) *[Ralɔ sɔ Vɔlɔvi]*\n"
"\n"
"The constellation Orion with its numerous bright stars and distinctive pattern dominates the winter sky and can be easily found. People from Macedonian villages usually point at the region around Orion’s belt saying that three bright stars and surrounding less bright stars create an image of a wooden Plough with two yoked oxen.\n"
"\n"
"##### Wolves (Volci) *[Voltsi]*\n"
"\n"
" Near to the plough with oxen, which is left on a field, people see two wolves as well. They are the bright stars Sirius in the constellation Canis Major and Procyon in Canis Minor.\n"
"\n"
"##### Priest’s Straw (Popova Slama) *[Popovᴧ Slᴧmᴧ]*\n"
"\n"
" Our galaxy (Milky Way) by its appearance is dominant on the summer sky\n"
"\n"
"##### Threshing floor (Gumno) *[Goumno]*\n"
"\n"
" Circular and foggy appearance of the Andromeda galaxy (М31) evoked people to see the threshing floor with straw from where the Priest was stealing from his Godson.\n"
"\n"
"##### Cross (Krst) *[Krst]*\n"
"\n"
"Complement with the people’s belief, when the Priest-thief saw God’s might he started running in panic and lost his cross on the way. So next to the Priest’s Straw there is the Cross.\n"
"\n"
"##### Ears (Ushi) *[Uʃi]*\n"
"\n"
"By this common word used as a jargon, Macedonian villagers mark the part of the wooden plough that goes into the soil, used for plowing.\n"
"\n"
"##### Trivet (Pirustija) *[Pirustiya]*\n"
"\n"
"The trivet is a metal device with three legs (tripod) which fits over the fireplace to support pans and kettles while preparing food.\n"
"\n"
"##### Tongs (Mashi) *[Maʃy]*\n"
"\n"
"The Tongs were used for the fire where the trivet is. Thus, the people’s constellation Tongs is very close to the constellation Trivet.\n"
"\n"
"##### Low round wooden dining table (Sofra) *[Sofra]*\n"
"\n"
"The typical semi-circular shape of the constellation Corona Borealis evoked the image of a wooden round table called sofra.\n"
"\n"
"##### Auger (Svrdel) *[Svrdǝl]*\n"
"\n"
"People say that this is a very big drill used for construction of houses and is found inside the Priest’s Straw\n"
"\n"
"##### Thieves (Aramii) *[Arami:]*\n"
"\n"
"The famous constellation Ursa Major among the people is described as a group of thieves. The seven bright stars of Ursa Major are said to be thieves „because during the entire night they circle on the sky same as thieves that circle around houses“"

"Maya culture was one of the most sophisticated civilizations in the pre-"
"columbian american continent. They developed a writing system which let them"
" store and use their knowledge in a variety of forms: e.g. on how to perform"
" rituals or delivering particular messages to an audience (political and "
"sacred facts from rulers to the people, sculpted in monuments and stelae). "
"These records allow us explore, through the laborious work of many "
"researchers, their cosmovision and how they thought the cosmos came to be. "
"Their knowledge was recorded in books (academically known as “codex”), like "
"the Dresden codex (which describes the dates that Venus would pass through "
"each of its visibility phases and also a table of lunar and solar eclipses),"
" the Paris codex (which is believed to describe some of their "
"constellations), the Madrid codex (which relates astronomy and agriculture "
"data) and lately, the Grolier codex (it was thought that it was an "
"abbreviated version of the Dresden codex, but it is not accepted yet as "
"original by some scholars)."

"All mayan codices are thought to have been taken to Europe by the first explorers of the New World, as evidence of their discoveries. The Paris Codex in particular was then long forgotten, until priest Leon Rosny found it in 1859 in a chimney corner of the National Library of Paris. It has suffered substantial damage, as can be seen in page 23 shown below. In spite of this, the Paris codex describes asterisms and constellations seen by the mayas, some of them probably related to a group of zodiacal constellations (Love, 1994)(Freidel et al., 1993)(Aveni, 2005), while others do not (Špoták, 2015).\n"

"In this approach to representing the constellations in Stellarium, we assume that are related to the ecliptic, since in the Paris codex they seem to \"swallow\" the Sun, so they are placed as close as possible to this line while trying to adjust the star patterns to the images of the different animals thought to represent zodiacal constellations. Other constellations are placed according to what ethnographic sources state are their most probable location.  Constellation lines were drawn trying to adjust to the images taken from the above mentioned sources and they appear according to the interpretation of the contributors of this culture."

This position in the sky is not really deduced from the Paris codex, but from the analysis made on the Bonampak murals, where the picture of the turtle is decorated with three points, very similar in position and orientation to Orion’s Belt, so this turtle representation has been used to place it in the Stellarium sky, instead of the one depicted in the Paris Codex.</td></tr>\n"

#. Modern sky culture description section in markdown format
msgid ""
"The modern sky culture divides the celestial sphere into 88 areas of various sizes called constellations, each with precise boundary, issued by the International Astronomical Union in 1922. These constellations have become the standard way to describe the sky, replacing similar sets in other sky cultures exhaustively in daily usage.\n"
"\n"
"The constellations in use today are based mainly on ancient Greek constellations depicted by Ptolemy in his book the Almagest during the 2nd century CE. In the subsequent centuries, this book has been translated from Greek into Arabic (6th to 9th century) and later to medieval Latin. In the Arabic more than in the Latin tradition, the Ptolemaic figures were enriched and transformed by native Arabic constellations and star names.\n"
"\n"
"In the 16-18th centuries, European astronomers suggested new constellations to fill the gaps between northern constellations (e.g. the constellation of \"the lynx\" for an area close to the Great Bear but with stars so faint that you would need the eyes of a lynx to see them) and also created new constellations in the southern part of the sky which had not been visible to Ptolemy. These new constellations were usually named after new technical inventions of the early modern period (e.g. a chemical furnace, a balloon, an air pump) or exotic animals (e.g. a chamaeleon, a tucan, a paradise bird). Among them several constellations were also named with political consideration to honor certain kings or patrons.\n"
"\n"
"In the beginning of the 20th century, the IAU (International Astronomical Union) aimed for a large clean-up: in 1922, it officially accepted the list of 88 constellation names. In 1928 it also defined precise constellation boundaries [#40] still in use today.\n"
"\n"
"### Extras\n"
"\n"
"In the 2nd century CE, Ptolemy in Alexandria published a multi-volume book which summarised the astronomical knowledge of the time, rooted in a tradition of mathematical astronomy since Hipparchus (at least 265 years earlier). In the subsequent centuries, this book has been translated from Greek into Arabic (6th to 9th century), from Arabic into Latin, and later, from the original ancient Greek into medieval Latin. Due to this transformation, it is now known under the artificial name Almagest, derived from the Arabic title [#46].\n"
"\n"
"The Almagest star catalogue (books VII and VIII) has been depicted many times in the Islamic as well as in the Christian astronomical traditions. Often, the figures were re-drawn in order to adapt them to the taste of art of the epoch. In the Arabic more than in the Latin tradition, the Ptolemaic figures were enriched and transformed by native Arabic constellations and star names. Therefore, this sky culture displays a modern descendant of the Ptolemaic one with traces of translations, misunderstandings, transformations, and deliberate additions.\n"
"\n"
"In 1603 the lawyer and hobby astronomer Johann Bayer from Augsburg, Germany, made a new celestial atlas, called Uranometria [#41]. In this atlas, he introduced a systematic naming of stars starting with alpha, the brightest, beta, the second brightest, gamma, the third ... within a constellation. Subsequently, it was established to name a star with a Greek letter and the Latin constellation name in casus genitive.\n"
"\n"
"In the 18th century, the century of great atlases (Flamsteed, Fortin, Bode: [#42][#43]), new constellations were added to fill the gaps between northern constellations. Additionally, there were suggestions to create new constellations in the southern part of the sky which had not been visible to Ptolemy. European astronomers visited the European colonies and instead of asking the native people for their constellations, the Europeans were creative. This way, many new technical inventions of the early modern period were depicted in constellations (e.g. a chemical furnace, a balloon, an air pump) as well as exotic animals (e.g. a chamaeleon, a tucan, a paradise bird).\n"
"\n"
"The problem was that sometimes astronomers did not agree with each other and, thus, atlases showed deviations from each other.\n"
"\n"
"After many centuries of astronomers taking liberties in interpretation of the Ptolemaic original, there were many variants of constellations. As constellations are a positioning system, i.e. astronomers describe positions in the sky relative to stars and stars relative to constellations (like \"Betelgeuse\", Orion's right shoulder), it is necessary to use constellation names and star names uniformly all over the world.\n"
"\n"
"In the \"Fin de siècle\", there were upcoming suggestions in the astronomical community to unify the system of constellations and star names [#44].\n"
"\n"
"The IAU, only founded in 1919, in 1928 defined the boundaries of these areas [#43] and not the way of drawing artwork or connecting lines within them. Consequently several sub-cultures of painting figures and drawing simplified stickfigures were developed during the 20th and 21st century. We provide some of them as further sky cultures.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"These constellations are based mainly on the Ptolemaic tradition which had been used in all three Abrahamitic religions and, thus, was common in the Near East, in Europe and its colonies on all continents. However, between the ancient Greek constellations there were gaps of areas with only faint stars belonging to no constellation.[#47] In the Modern Epoch, several astronomers suggested constellation figures for these gaps, among them several political constellations to the honor of certain kings or patrons. In the late 19th century, the astronomical research community aimed for a huge clean-up to avoid ambiguities in assigning stars to constellations.\n"
"\n"
"In 1922, the IAU officially approved the list of 88 constellation names and their official abbreviations with three letters. The only remaining political constellation is Scutum, the shield of a Polish king but without mentioning the political reference anymore. The Belgian priest E. Delporte got the task to define constellation boundaries according to coordinates. In 1928, he finished the work, based on an atlas from Argentina [#51], and the IAU accepted his delimitations [#40].\n"
"\n"
"These \"constellations\" are naked areas in the sky without any stick figures or depictions [#44]. The borders simply follow the lines of right ascension and declination from the epoch 1875.0. Precession causes a slowly increasing deviation from the originally rectilinear grid. These constellations became the standard way to describe the sky, replacing similar sets in other sky cultures exhaustively in daily usage.\n"
"\n"
"Stellarium by default displays the precise RA-DEC-boundaries and a set of artwork constellations on the basis of Ptolemaic figures but following our contemporary taste of art.\n"
"\n"
"### Asterisms\n"
"\n"
"The term \"asterism\" (assembly of stars) can sometimes be used synonymously to \"constellation\". In the modern use it describes a figure which is not part of the official canon. Sometimes an asterism is a part of a constellation, e.g. the Big Dipper as part of Ursa Major, or Great Square as part of Pegasus. Other asterisms span over several constellations, e.g. the Summer Triangle or Winter Hexagon. Yet others are only visible in binoculars or telescopes and are aptly named \"telescopic asterism\", e.g. the Coathanger. They are often discussed in the observing columns of popular astronomy magazines.\n"
"\n"
"### Ray Helpers\n"
"\n"
"Seasoned observers can find their way around the sky easily. One mnemonic tool are associative chains of stars that span large distances. We show them as \"ray helpers\". These are not standardized.\n"
"\n"
"### Proper names of stars\n"
"\n"
"Ptolemy's star catalogue had the layout of a table listing the description of the star's position in the constellation's figure, the ecliptical coordinates, and the magnitude e.g.: \"The star at the tip of the tail of Ursa Minor\", \"Gem 0 1/6, +66\", \"Mag 3\".\n"
"\n"
"In most cases, the star names evolved by astronomer's systematical abbreviations of these descriptions, e.g., a first astronomer abbreviated in a text \"tip of the tail\", a next astronomer drew a map with less space and wrote only \"tail\" next to the star and this name remained. Over centuries, these descriptions were translated into Arabic and Latin, and in some cases the translators or scribes made mistakes because of misreading or misspelling of the Arabic words (e.g. the Arabic \"yad al gauza\", the hand of the giant woman, was mangled to the common term \"Betelgeuse\").\n"
"\n"
"However, there are also a few original Greek words like the red star \"Antares\", the counterpart of Ares (Mars), and even a few original Babylonian terms like \"Shargaz\", the Sting, in Scorpius. Our modern, most recent IAU star names [#45] are a renewed mixture, also with influences or even politically wanted additions of star names from the non-Ptolemaic sky cultures, e.g. the traditional Pingsing, a Chinese star name for a star in Hydra (its meaning is only \"star\", a reminescence to his lonely position), or newly adopted star names from Polynesian, Hawaiian, or Aboriginal cultures for names of stars with exoplanets.\n"
"\n"
"The IAU is the only scientifically accepted authority to assign new names to stars. Commercial exploits like \"star name registries\", who sell stars for commemorative purposes or as gifts, only sell printed pieces of paper. These names are not approved and never used by scientists."

"\n"
"The modern Chinese use the constellations of the International Astronomical Union. The traditional Chinese constellations have no specific boundaries between them. They only represent the corresponding set of bright stars, and do not have the role of dividing the celestial sphere into different areas, so they are no longer applicable in astronomy.\n"
"\n"
"### Star names\n"
"\n"
"The Chinese now use traditional star names instead of Western star names. More than 3,000 stars have traditional Chinese star names. When a foreign astronomical book is translated into Chinese, the star names will also be translated into traditional Chinese star names. There are some special stars that use the names of Western stars, such as Proxima, Van Maanen's star, which can usually only be seen with a telescope, but with special astronomical significance.\n"

These new constellations were usually named after new technical inventions of the early modern period (e.g. a chemical furnace, a balloon, an air pump) or exotic animals (e.g. a chamaeleon, a tucan, a paradise bird).

"These constellations are based mainly on the Ptolemaic tradition which had been used in all three Abrahamitic religions and, thus, was common in the Near East, in Europe and its colonies on all continents. However, between the ancient Greek constellations there were gaps of areas with only faint stars belonging to no constellation.[#5] In the Modern Epoch, several astronomers suggested constellation figures for these gaps, among them several political constellations to the honor of certain kings or patrons. In the late 19th century, the astronomical research community aimed for a huge clean-up to avoid ambiguities in assigning stars to constellations.\n"
"\n"
"In 1922, the IAU officially approved the list of 88 constellation names and their official abbreviations with three letters. The only remaining political constellation is Scutum, the shield of a Polish king but without mentioning the political reference anymore. The Belgian priest E. Delporte got the task to define constellation boundaries according to coordinates. In 1928, he finished the work, based on an atlas from Argentina [#6], and the IAU accepted his delimitations [#4].\n"
"\n"
"These \"constellations\" are naked areas in the sky without any stick figures or depictions [#1]. The borders simply follow the lines of right ascension and declination from the epoch 1875.0. Precession causes a slowly increasing deviation from the originally rectilinear grid. These constellations became the standard way to describe the sky, replacing similar sets in other sky cultures exhaustively in daily usage.\n"
"\n"
"#### Constellation Figures\n"
"\n"
"In star maps it is common to mark line \"patterns\" that represent the shapes that give the name to the constellations. However, the IAU defines a constellation by its boundary (indicated by sky coordinates) and not by its pattern and the same constellation may have several variants in its representation.\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture uses constellation figures were produced in collaboration with \"Sky and Telescope\" magazine (Roger Sinnott and Rick Fienberg) and published at IAU official website [#1]. Alan MacRobert's constellation patterns, were influenced by those of H. A. Rey but in many cases were adjusted to preserve earlier traditions.\n"
"\n"
"### Proper names of stars\n"
"\n"
"Ptolemy's star catalogue had the layout of a table listing the description of the star's position in the constellation's figure, the ecliptical coordinates, and the magnitude e.g.: \"The star at the tip of the tail of Ursa Minor\", \"Gem 0 1/6, +66\", \"Mag 3\".\n"
"\n"
"In most cases, the star names evolved by astronomer's systematical abbreviations of these descriptions, e.g., a first astronomer abbreviated in a text \"tip of the tail\", a next astronomer drew a map with less space and wrote only \"tail\" next to the star and this name remained. Over centuries, these descriptions were translated into Arabic and Latin, and in some cases the translators or scribes made mistakes because of misreading or misspelling of the Arabic words (e.g. the Arabic \"yad al gauza\", the hand of the giant woman, was mangled to the common term \"Betelgeuse\").\n"
"\n"
"However, there are also a few original Greek words like the red star \"Antares\", the counterpart of Ares (Mars), and even a few original Babylonian terms like \"Shargaz\", the Sting, in Scorpius. Our modern, most recent IAU star names [#7] are a renewed mixture, also with influences or even politically wanted additions of star names from the non-Ptolemaic sky cultures, e.g. the traditional Pingsing, a Chinese star name for a star in Hydra (its meaning is only \"star\", a reminescence to his lonely position), or newly adopted star names from Polynesian, Hawaiian, or Aboriginal cultures for names of stars with exoplanets.\n"
"\n"
"The IAU is the only scientifically accepted authority to assign new names to stars. Commercial exploits like \"star name registries\", who sell stars for commemorative purposes or as gifts, only sell printed pieces of paper. These names are not approved and never used by scientists.\n"
"\n"
"### Proper names of deep-sky objects\n"
"\n"
"Uranometria 2000.0 is an atlas of the 2000.0 era starry sky prepared by the Dutch artist Wil Tirion and published in 1987 by the American publishing house Willmann-Bell, specializing in astronomical literature.\n"
"\n"
"The Atlas of Tirion, respected by astronomers for its accuracy and beauty, is provided with detailed tables and various indexes. The second volume contains three transparent overlays designed for precise measurements. Uranometria 2000.0 contains more than 280,000 stars and more than 30,000 deep-sky objects - in particular, all the objects of the Messier and NGC catalogs.\n"
"\n"
"The second (corrected and most complete) three-volume edition of \"Uranometria 2000.0\", was published in 2001 under the name \"Uranometria 2000.0 Deep Sky Atlas\" and contains 280035 stars of both hemispheres up to 9.75<sup>m</sup> in size on a scale of 1.85 cm per declination degree on 220 spreads of A3 format. Particular attention in the atlas is paid to deep-sky objects, there are more than 30 thousand of them in the second edition - many times more than in any other paper atlas.\n"
"\n"
"The third volume of \"Uranometria 2000.0\" is a guide to deep-sky objects - Deep Sky Field Guide, consisting of tables with scientific data and proper names on objects depicted in the first two volumes [#3]."

"<img src=\"illustrations/Rey_cover.png\" width=\"150\" align=\"right\"/> H. A. Rey (Hans Augusto Reyersbach) (1898-1977), an artist and author of children's books of German descent but emigrated to the USA, published his answer to this problem in 1952 with the book *The Stars - A New Way To See Them*[#1][#2].\n"
"\n"
"### The Constellations\n"
"\n"
"In this book, which has become very popular especially in the US, Rey connected the stars of every constellation \"in such a way that the resulting shape makes sense.\" What surprised him was \"that nobody has done it before. The basic idea is so simple.\"\n"
"\n"
"Rey's new stick figures make it indeed very simple to recognize the depicted constellation figures. Rey's work does not include figurative artwork, therefore this sky culture deliberately only comes with Rey's original stick figures. The constellation names were also always given in English by Rey. If you switch to \"Native\" name display mode, you may see exactly the spelling used in his book. Also the stars named here are limited to those included in the book.\n"
"\n"
"### Rey's Figures and the Classic Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Rey's constellations adhere to the tradition of the Western sky culture and describes the 88 officially acknowledged constellations, with addition of asterisms of the two Dippers and the \"Great Square\" (of Pegasus). However, at several points Rey's figures deviate from the canonical figures described since Ptolemy's Almagest (2nd century AD), where also positions of the stars in their constellations had been described in their names. For example,\n"
"\n"
" - Rey inverted the figure of the Great Bear (*Ursa Major*) to look like a polar bear scenting prey. This on one hand does not have the usual problem to explain its long tail. On the other hand, the bear is not shown to walk around the pole in this orientation.\n"
" - The Bull (*Taurus*), only the front of which is shown with long upright horns in usual depictions, is shown with a complete body including its tail, with horns stretched wide like those of a buffalo. Its bright eye *Aldebaran* now lies in its neck.\n"
" - The head of *Hercules* is usually next to the head of *Ophiuchus*, the serpent holder, and the four stars known as \"keystone\" form his body. Rey makes his head out of the keystone, and the star that usually marks the hero's head is now one of his feet.\n"
" - The Whale (*Cetus*) has been turned around, its former mouth now forming a tail fin.\n"
" - *Pegasus* exchanged feet and head.\n"
" - *Bootes*, the herdsman, is shown sitting and smoking a pipe (no trace of political correctness in a children's book of the 1950s... :-)\n"

"### Figures in the sky\n"
"\n"
"People have probably always looked up to the stars. Some of them might wonder, what those little dots of light meant, up there. In their thoughts they connected the stars to form images and thus created their very own constellations.\n"
"\n"
"Each culture had different ideas about what was going on in the night sky. And so each culture painted different figures in the sky. In the western world, a sky culture emerged that, along with other influences, was strongly influenced by Greek mythology. This western sky culture established itself as the standard in modern astronomy."

"### Division of the sky\n"
"\n"
"In 1922 the International Astronomical Union began to define this standard more precisely. 88 constellations were selected that covered the entire sky. The names and the boundaries of the 88 constellations were made binding, but not the historically created shapes of the constellations themselves.\n"
"\n"
"### From image to constellation\n"
"\n"
"Greek mythology is rich in stories about gods and heroes. These stories have not been forgotten until today, among other things through the works of Hesiod and Homer. Atlases were created that showed the starry sky, illustrated with figures from Greek mythology. The stars in these figures were connected by lines, creating constellations. It was clear what these constellations were supposed to represent. But if you looked at the lines alone without the corresponding figures, the connection to the constellation was often no longer immediately understandable\n"
"\n"
"### The stars, a new way to see them\n"
"\n"
"The children's book author H. A. Rey recognized this dilemma. He wondered why it had never occurred to anyone to draw the constellations so, that their shape made sense. He connected stars with lines and thus painted his own constellations. These constellations were intuitively recognizable, because the constellation lines themselves painted the images. H. A. Rey published his work under the title \"The Stars. A New Way To See Them\".\n"
"\n"
"### The sky culture sternenkarten.com\n"
"\n"
"The sky culture sternenkarten.com is based on the idea of H. A. Rey to paint constellations in such a way, that they can be recognized intuitively. Some of the constellations, it contains, are more or less similar to those of H. A. Rey, others are based on the western standard sky culture. And still others have been completely redesigned.\n"
"\n"
"As far as possible, the following points have been implemented\n"
"\n"
" - Clear simple shapes\n"
" - Intuitive recognizability\n"
" - Recognizing is more important than the inclusion of many stars\n"
" - Fainter stars are not considered because of the light pollution in the modern world\n"
" - Triangles are easy to spot. That is why the characters wear triangular hats\n"
"\n"
"The following special features were built into the constellation culture:\n"
"\n"
" - The constellation Lynx uses a star from the constellation Great Bear\n"
" - The constellation Snake is not divided into two parts. A complete snake is drawn\n"
" - The star Alpheratz belongs to both the constellation Pegasus and the constellation Andromeda\n"

"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
" Generally, stars represent animals turning around the North Star which is symbolized by the Golden Nail (*Altan Hadaas*). Almost all Mongolian asterisms are similar to those that we know. However some have other names like *Num Sum* (The Bow and the Arrow) for the constellation Swan, or *Doloon Burkhan* for the seven stars of the Big Dipper. The summer triangle made up of Vega, Deneb and Altair stars refers to three stags (*Gurvan Maral Od* in Mongolian). And Cassiopeia represents, in the Mongolian imagination, the Five Stars Woman (*Hun Tavan Od*).\n"
"\n"
"### Planets and Stars\n"
"\n"
" Originally, Tibeto-Mongolian astrology calculates the positions of each of the planets visible with the naked eye. Because planets beyond Saturn are not visible without telescope (the instrument which appeared long time after the creation of their astrology), the Mongolians have attributed one of the five planets for each day of the week, completing with the Sun (*Nar*) for Sunday and the Moon (*Sar*) for Monday. The names of the Solar System's planets and Pluto have some peculiarities in Mongolian. Mercury is named *Bud* (associated with Wednesday), Venus, *Sugar* (associated with Friday), the Earth, *Delkhii*, Mars, *Angarag* (associated with Tuesday), Jupiter, *Barhasbadi* (associated with Thursday), Saturn, *Sanchir* (associated with Saturday), Uranus, *Tengeriin-van*, Neptune, *Dalai-van* and at last Pluto, *Dalkhii-van*. We can see that the three last, invisible to the naked eye and discovered long time after the others, have the characteristic to have the particle *-van* at the end of the name, indicating the princely status in Mongolian. Earth and Pluto are named similarly, except that this last one has this particle. It is possible to translate from Mongolian Pluto like \"The princely ground\" (ground and not Earth because it means here the surface on which we walk, not the Earth. Uranus, *Tengeriin-van*, could be translated as \"princely sky\", and Neptune, *Dalai-van*, as the \"princely ocean\". Nevertheless, this particle has no real equivalent in English, and translations above are presented to give an idea of the planet name's meaning. However, the names of the celestial bodies specified here come from Sanskrit (language spoken in India) and are largely used in the current language in Mongolia but in an unofficial way.\n"
"\n"
" It is also very interesting to see the tight link between terms designating other celestial bodies and their beliefs: indeed, *Tengeriin Zadas* appoints the Milky Way. We could literally translate this as the \"Sky Line\" (*Tengeriin* for the sky, which also means the god of the sky, and *Zadas* for the line). Well known in Mongolian star lore concerns Alcor, the star located above Mizar in the Greater Bear. It symbolises the recover and protection star. It was placed here by *Tengeriin* (god of heaven) to protect Mizar. To become an archer for Genghis Khan (13th century), it seemed that one had to be able to discern these two stars with the naked eye.\n"
"\n"
" From a historic point of view, this excellent knowledge of the sky goes back to *Ulug Beg* (AD1394-1449; *Taraghay* by his real name), astronomer, mathematician and viceroy in Samarkand whose empire spread as far as Central Asia. Turning away from his royal obligations, he examined celestial bodies and astronomical questions of his time. He is the first to extremely precisely measure Saturn's revolution period (*Sanchir*) with a sextant of 40 meters radius.\n"

" Mongolians are particularly attached to the Great Bear. This constellation is limited for them to the seven Dipper stars making the bear's tail and body, but the legend concerning it is probably the most famous in Mongolia.\n"
"\n"
"> Once upon a time, there were eight orphan brothers gifted with outstanding capabilities living within a kingdom. The king and the queen lived within it peacefully. One day, a monster came and kidnapped the queen. The king asked the eight brothers to bring her back and said: \"If one of you succeeds to rescue my beloved, I will give to him a golden arrow\". The orphans went together to assist their queen. They searched the monster during two days and three nights, when in the middle of the third night, they found and killed the monster. They brought back the queen in the castle.\n"
">\n"
"> The king did not split the arrow in eight parts, he decided to throw it into the sky. The first to catch it should keep it. The younger brother succeeded the test and changed immediately into the North Star (Polar Star). The seven others changed into the seven gods, the seven Buddhas visiting their younger brother every night. The name *Doloon burkhan* (the Seven Buddhas) come from this legend to appoint the Great Bear and the Golden Nail, *Altan Hadaas*, the Polar Star.\n"
"\n"
" A tradition, particularly delightful, concerns the link between Mongolian people and the Greater Bear as one star of this constellation is attributed to each of them. It depends on their birth year in the Chinese calendar. Chinese and Mongolian calendars have some similarities (the Mongolian calendar is a lunar calendar). Each year is symbolized by an animal, itself associated to a star of the constellation Greater Bear. The first, Dubhe, corresponds to the rat's year, the second, Merak, corresponds to the ox and so on until the end of the Great Bear's tail where Alkaid symbolizes the year of the horse. Then we come back to the first, the sheep year and we repeat the same way until the twelfth and latest year of the Chinese calendar, the one of the pig. Therefore, the two stars at the end of the tail are assigned one time only.\n"
"\n"
"[Note by G. Zotti: This is a variant of the old Seven Buddha Sutra described by *Elverskog* [#2]. There however, the association of the stars goes in an up-and-down movement, i.e., Dubhe/Rat, Merak/Ox, ... Mizar/Snake, Alkaid/Horse, Mizar/Goat, ... Merak/Pig.]\n"
" <img src=\"illustrations/doloon_burkhan.png\" width=\"550\">\n"
"\n"
"### Shooting stars\n"
"\n"
" Shooting stars have also a specific meaning: they are personified through their beliefs. When they see these shooting stars they imagine that it is a star which falls from the sky and which symbolizes somebody who just died. Whereas occidental people make a wish, Mongolians say: \"Phew, it is not me!\"\n"
"\n"
"### Neglected Legends\n"
"\n"
" Three legends just as rich in meaning concern the Sun, eclipses and *Hun Tavan Od* (Cassiopeia). However, they are nowadays neglected and almost forgotten by most Mongolians:\n"
"\n"
"#### Sun\n"
"\n"
"> At the origin of the world, there was only one man and vast particularly dry meadows, burned by the seven suns which lit the world. This man, a very good archer, made the promise to the gods that he pierced all these suns without missing a target even once. If he should fail, he would cut himself all the fingers one by one and leave to live in a hole like a marmot (groundhog) to ward off the curse that would weigh on him. He took his bow, pulled a first arrow and hit his target. A second, a third until the sixth which destroyed the suns. He finished by pulling his seventh arrow towards the last sun, when a swallow flew off and passed through its direction. The bird was hit. The man had not reached his goal, so he left towards exile in a hole, cut his fingers and turned into a marmot. The swallow had just saved our Sun, otherwise all life would have disappeared from the world's surface.\n"
"\n"
" We have to see here a parallel with the number seven, important in the Mongolian culture like all odd numbers. They bring luck in the buddhist religion.\n"
"\n"
"#### Eclipses\n"
"\n"
"> At that time lived a scary monster named *Raah* which frightened the entire world. He devoured all who were in its way. The god *Orchiwaani* owned a magic spring: whoever drank from it became immortal. One day, *Raah* stole the spring and drunk. The Moon and the Sun caught the monster in the act and reported to *Orchiwaani*. Seething with rage to hear about this piece of news he went to fight the monster. He cut its head many times but it grew again immediately because *Raah* had become immortal. He thought then to cut its tail in order to allow all that it ate to leave again directly. Just as *Orchiwaani* would seize the monster to finish it off, it escaped and disappeared between the Moon and the Sun. Then *Orchiwaani* asked the Moon, who recaptured *Raah* and cut its rump and its tail. In revenge, the monster comes back sometimes to eat the Moon or the Sun which exit immediately, giving rise to moon and solar eclipses.\n"
"\n"
"When there is an eclipse, Mongolians know that it means that *Raah* devours the Moon or the Sun and they make a lot of noise so that the monster liberates the eclipsed star. In the 13th century, Guillaume de Rubruck wrote:\n"
"\n"
"> \"Some [Mongolian people] have knowledge in astronomy and predict them [to other Mongolian people] the Lunar and Solar eclipses and, when it is about to produce one, everybody stocks up on food because they do not pass the door of their habitation. And while the eclipse happened, they play the drum and instruments and do big noise and clamors. When the eclipse is finished, they devote themselves to beverage and festivity and do big party.\"\n"
"\n"
"(Source: [#1])\n"
"\n"
"Eclipse travelers in 2008 still witnessed drivers and cooks hiding in their tents and making noise with the pots. It seemed authentic, not a show for the tourists. Also note the similarity of *Raah* with Indian *Rahu*.\n"
"\n"
"#### Cassiopeia (*Hun Tavan Od*)\n"
"\n"
"Cassiopeia (*Hun Tavan Od*) symbolises unity, brotherhood, solidarity for the Mongolians. The constellation's five stars represent unity of the five children of Genghis Khan's wife, Oulin.\n"
"\n"
"> Them did not get well along with each other and squabbled all the time. Their mother decided to strongly tie five ropes, and each one should try to untie a knot. If they succeeded, it meant that they didn't remain united with each other, and that the brotherhood didn't gather in hard times. Conversely, if the knots withstood the test, the five brothers would remain united and close for the rest of their lives and would be victorious at the time of wars.\n"
"\n"
"### Other Beliefs Linked to the Sky\n"
"\n"
"According to a Mongolian legend, a woman devoting herself to count one hundred stars in the sky will dream about her future husband.\n"
"\n"
" Sometimes, Mongolians honor the Greater Bear (*Doloon Burkhan*) by throwing milk in its direction. Milk, of white color, symbolizes purity in Mongolia. They pray so that something may be fulfilled, but for several persons, not for just one person, because this would bring bad luck. Milk can be replaced by vodka which, even if it is colorless, symbolizes the dark color and the strength for Mongolians. By doing this, it avoids bad luck, quarrels, fear and fends off evil spirits.\n"
"\n"
"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
" The constellations are inspired by occidental ones, but the Mongolian cosmogony, briefly exposed here, highlights a notable identity of beliefs which are associated with it. Mongolian culture and knowledge transmission is essentially oral, and so few written traces exist about these subjects. It is therefore particularly hard to relate their cosmogony with high fidelity and precision. In order to preserve knowledge about this cosmogony, every observation, suggestions or collaboration are welcome!\n"

#. Northern Andes sky culture description section in markdown format

"In order to replicate the ancestral measurements in the Andean observatories, we propose the use of a wide-mouth container; in the open we will place it and level properly. In order to create a star mirror we will fill it with water, in this reflection of the sky, the Andean sage can admire and record the movements of the sun, the moon, planets or the stars.\n"
"\n"
"The Stellarium simulator allows us to recreate these \"cosmic mirrors\" and analyze the specific stellar dynamics that are seen in the Northern Andes as well as the millenarian wise men in their patient observation through the ages. These beings have registered the cosmic movements in the current prehispanic heritage of the Andean peoples and produced graphic configurations, which after much joint work by several researchers in several generations at the beginning of the 21st century have been partially decoded.\n"
"\n"
"Here we tell what we found in the equatorial skies:\n"
"\n"
"### The Sun (Punchao o Wilca)\n"
"\n"
"When we find ourselves in the center of the planet, the apparent movement that the sun makes through our annual journey around it is equidistant and proportional. At the equinoxes the sun will cross the center of the sky, on the solstice of June it will travel its southernmost road (it will go north) and on the solstice of December the northernmost path will be traveled (more to the south). These natural phenomena are the marks of the four main festivals that celebrate a specific part of the agricultural calendar because they are the points of inflection between the climatic seasons.\n"
"\n"
"According to the colonial chronicler Juan de Betanzos \"the Indians knew the leap years\"; thanks to the research of Gustavo Guayasamín, a cyclic movement is identified in a four-year interval in the sun; to observe it, we suggest placing ourselves at the March equinox (approximately the March equinoxes are the 21st day in the Gregorian calendar), at the solar daytime (12:20 in the civil time for the year 2018). We can then move forward in time thanks to the \"Date / Time Window\" from year to year and we will notice that the sun moves, returning to the point where the observation begins in periods of four years, for example: It starts in 2016, moves to the left of the spectator in 2017, continues moving to the left in 2018, also moves in 2019 and in 2020 returns to its initial position; then start the cycle again.\n"
"\n"
"### Clear Constellations, Asterisms and Guidelines in the Andes.\n"
"\n"
"We consider that by means of \"stellar mirrors\" the sages could register the stellar traffic. Through this observation they noticed that during the nightfalls of each equinox and solstice, specific stars appear in the sky, as if they were marking the climatic changes to which we are exposed, so these cosmic signals were recorded in the Andean prehispanic patrimony giving rise to the Andean geometrical forms.\n"
"\n"
"#### March Equinox\n"
"\n"
"**\"Antonio Quinatoa\" Cross:** At dusk the first stars to appear are: Sirius - Procyon - Rigel - Betelgeuse, who form the cross named \"Antonio Quinatoa\". It is the constellation that governs the masculine cycle.\n"
"\n"
"#### September Equinox\n"
"\n"
"**Molestina Triangle:** The first stars to appear are: Altair - Vega - Antares who make up the triangle named \"Molestina\"\n"
"\n"
"**Constellation Daniela Alejandra Ayala:** Thanks to the hard work in the registration of the designs, we have identified the clear constellation named \"Daniela Alejandra Ayala\", cosmic set that accompanies the image of the \"Mono Andino\", will appear in the center of the sky at nightfall of the female equinox.\n"
"\n"
"#### June Solstice\n"
"\n"
"**South Cross:** The most outstanding stars in the evening of the Summer Solstice for the Northern Hemisphere are: Acrux, Mimosa, δ Crucis, ζ Crucis, λ Crucis and μ Crucis who form the \"Southern Cross\".\n"
"\n"
"#### December Solstice\n"
"\n"
"**The “Jorge Trujillo” Arrow:** The most outstanding stars in the evening of the winter solstice for the southern hemisphere are Caph - Shedar - Navi - κ Cas, they are part of the western constellation of Cassiopeia, the resulting form evokes the shape of an arrow that at the end of the December solstice It is in an East - West direction.\n"
"\n"
"The asterisms that we include are the first stars to appear at the end of each equinox or solstice. Like the constellations, these basic forms (diamond, square, triangle and arrow), mark the beginning or end of a cycle, apparently human beings discovered and recorded them before the forms in the dark constellations.\n"
"\n"
"### The Sacred Beings in the Cosmos. The Dark Constellations.\n"
"\n"
"#### The Milky Way\n"
"\n"
"Our planet belongs to the galaxy of the Milky Way, whose shape is that of a large disk with two bulging arms; this form and the rotation of the earth means that at the evenings of the equinoxes and solstices we can appreciate a specific part of it, thus becoming a signal that the ancestors appreciated to measure the times. Called in the Andes as the \"Muyun\" for many peoples, it represents a gigantic life-giving serpent.\n"
"\n"
"Contrary to the West, the constellations are not made up of bright points or stars; the astral beings are housed in the \"dark spots\" existing in the brilliance of the Milky Way, so at each of the turning points in our annual path around the sun (Solstices and Equinoxes), we will find a guiding constellation in each \"visible end\" of the galaxy. As with lunar or solar movements, the movements of the constellations in the Northern Andes marked the beginning or end of specific eras, agricultural, civil, reproductive or festive. They determined the fate of beings, receiving respect and veneration for those who came for their wisdom; thus developing a religious thought similar to that of the sun or the moon throughout the continent.\n"

"The names of the stars in the Tahitian sky mainly come from the \"genealogy of the stars\", a text which was recited to the English missionary John Muggridge \n"
"Orsmond in 1818 by Ruanui, an old lady from Bora Bora, in the leeward islands, northwest of Tahiti. It was enhanced thanks to the logbook of J.R. Forster, \n"
"a naturalist on the 2nd expedition of Captain James Cook (1772-1776), but also thanks to accounts from Europeans living in Tahiti at the end of the 18th \n"
"century such as J.Morisson (1789-1791) and lastly thanks to the many observations and records of the first missionnaries at the turn of the 19th century.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Genealogy of the stars\" was published later on by Teuira Henry, the granddaughter of J. M. Orsmond, in the book \"Ancient Tahiti\" (1928). This long poem, \n"
"whose key asset was its transcription in the vernacular tongue by J.Orsmond in 1818, then translated in English, narrates the birth of the stars, the Moon, \n"
"the Sun and the planets as a genealogy. Children of the divine couple Rua-tupua-nui and Atea, the astral bodies, take partners and give birth to other celestial \n"
"bodies to populate the sky. Shell, egg or seed, the sky is seen as a creator space revealing divine manifestations such as clouds, swells, currents and winds \n"
"and yielding the principle of life.\n"
"\n"
"### Linking space, time and men: an \"environmental\" calendar\n"
"\n"
"Based on very precise observations, the experts of ancient times or tahu'a developed an acute knowledge of the stellar movement, linking closely the sky, \n"
"the space and the time to the cycles of the environment, of the animals and of the plants. They were indissociable. This knowledge was passed down in the \n"
"form of environmental calendars. Known and controlled by the elites, leaders and specialists, those calendars planned the propitiatory ceremonies and the \n"
"community activities such as agriculture and fishing. They were set on the observation of the stars, planets and constellations, and related to the Sun's \n"
"come and go movement between north and south, the shifting of the Moon, the seasons of the main winds and swells. The astral bodies, observed at night, \n"
"after the sunset or before sunrise, were bearers of different functions which are available to us through their names which are oftentimes long, but which \n"
"give each of them a proper identity. For example, the Pleiades, also called Matari'i in Tahiti, had a crucial cultural role and were used namely to divide \n"
"the year into 2 seasons: from November to May, a hot and rainy season, known as the season of abundance, Matari'i I ni'a, and set on the fruiting of the \n"
"breadfruit tree or 'uru and the return of the migrating pelagic fishes. The second season, cooler, drier, known as the season of restrictions, Matari'i i \n"
"raro from May to November, during which the root crops / tubers were replacing the 'uru and the fishing in the lagoon replaced the offshore fishing.\n"
"\n"
"### Explore, navigate and build alliances\n"
"\n"
"\"Star navigation\" was the subject of much research in order to determine how the reading of the sky allowed the Polynesian people to navigate with such \n"
"accuracy during journeys over thousands of km between remote islands. Today the names of the stars and of the constellations are becoming keys to approach \n"
"the ancient voyagers' vision of the sky: markers to reach a target island and to come back to one's island home, but also to make inter-islands alliances \n"
"for in a broad sense, in the Polynesian mindset one always belongs to a network, whether it be one of men, of the divinities of the ocean or of the space. \n"
"Jean-Claude Teriierooiterai, linguist and Tahitian anthropologist, spent some of his life trying to resolve this mystery. He suggested a classification of \n"
"the names of the stars by their usage. Hence, the stars Pou (Pillars) were used to locate the meridians whereas the stars Ta'urua would indicate a Rua. \n"
"The Rua of the stars correspond to a succession of stars rising on the horizon at an essentially identical declination and they would enable the voyager \n"
"to steer a course (Thesis \"Mythes, astronomie, découpage du temps et navigation traditionnelle : l'héritage océanien contenu dans les mots de la langue \n"
"tahitienne\", J-C Teriierooiterai, 2013).\n"
"\n"
"Today, the \"Fa'afaite i te Ao Ma'ohi\" association keeps these traditional navigation techniques alive by travelling between the polynesian islands on a \n"
"traditional Polynesian double-hulled canoe.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Some names of constellations managed to reach us thanks to the \"Genealogy of the stars\" by Ruanui and by the popular use, yet our knowledge of the asterisms \n"
"of the Tahitian sky is only in its infancy. Therefore, we only mention a few names and representations on this topic. However it is interesting to notice \n"
"that certain constellations of the Tahitian sky could get a different name depending on the season and on their observation. For example, the constellation \n"
"of the Scorpio was visible shaped like a hook \"Matau a Maui\" (Maui's hook) at the beginning of the Matari'i i ni'a season. The same constellation is shaped \n"
"like a \"'Uo\" (kite) during the Matari'i i raro season, which is also the season of the southeast wind, the Mara'amu and the season of the kites, hence lending \n"
"it a different function.\n"
"\n"
"### Nomenclature of the Tahitian sky on Stellarium\n"
"\n"
"One star having many functions, it could often have many names related to the context, the season or the inherent activities. Therefore the same name can \n"
"correspond to several stars. For example in the reference book \"Ancient Tahiti\" in its English version, several texts describe \"Ana roto\" at times as Epi/Spica \n"
"in Virgo (p361), at other times as Regulus in Leo (p174). A rigorous comparison study of the existing sources led the authors of this sky culture to prefer a \n"
"\"first name\" for each star listed. That one will appear while navigating the Stellarium. By clicking on a given star you will be able to see all its other \n"
"possible names. Libor Teaonui Prokop, well known in the Polynesian culture in Tahiti, also presented an alpha-numeric naming which allows to give a unique \n"
"name to each star and summarize the different sources existing for that star. In this classification, for example, Regulus is called \"A3a 'Ana roto\" and \n"
"Epi/Spica \"A3b 'Ana roto\". Whenever available, this naming will be visible by clicking on the star. A is the 1st letter of the word 'Ana (star): the number \n"
"corresponds to the order of the 'Ana stars listed in the \"Genealogy of the stars\" in the book by Teuira HENRY p361, the letter corresponds to the selected \n"

"### Sources\n"
"\n"
"Stellarium's Sami sky culture is based on the work of Bo Lundmark[#3], who based much of his work on the writings of the Sami artist and author Johan Turi.\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture is a conglomeration of at least three slightly different cultures from the people of the South-Sami, North-Sami and Russian Sami. Each of these groups have slightly different languages and as such there may be small differences with some references.\n"
"\n"
"Sami constellations can be observed on Sami artifacts connected to the old religion, suggesting that the night sky played an important cultural role for Sami peoples in years gone by.\n"
"\n"
"The Sami sky culture has a lot in common with other arctic and sub-arctic cultures in Eurasia. One unfortunate similarity is that much of the culture was lost before it was recorded properly.\n"
"\n"
"### Constellations and Stars\n"
"\n"
"The Sami constellations are probably very old but were recorded in writing during the 19th century. In is unclear if the written record is complete. The constellations and stars included here are all connected to the dominant constellation, *Sarva* &mdash; the elk. Sarva is the Sami name for elk, an alternative name is *Sarvvis* &mdash; Bull elk. The origin of this constellation probably dates back to the old hunter culture before reindeer were domesticated.\n"
"\n"
"*Sarva* consists of the Western constellations Cassiopeia, Perseus and parts of Auriga. Constellations and stars surrounding Sarva represent hunters of the elk. *Favdna* (also transcribed as *Favtna*) is the star Arcturus, and represents the Hunter who aims at the elk with his bow and arrow (*Fauna davgge* &mdash; the Big Dipper). Favdna must aim well, for if he hits the Sky Support *Boahjenaste* (the star Polaris), legend has it that the world will come to an end.\n"
"\n"
"Favdna has a number of helpers: *Galla* (Procyon<sup>[1](#note1)</sup>) and his sons *Gallabarneck* (Orion's belt), the \"Ski Runners\", *Cuoigahægjek* (Castor and Pollux) and \"The Runner\" (Vega). The Pleiades are called *Rougot* (dog pack) or *Miese-cora* (calfpack).\n"
"\n"
"The Milky Way is called *Lodde-raiddaras* (lit. bird path) or *Jakke-mærka* (lit. year mark). The name used depends on the season. In the sky chart of Johan Turi, one can observe a star *Guovso-naste*, morning star, that can be identified as Venus, but this is not certain as it can also be identified as Altair, a star showing the morning is approaching (similar to Arcturus in the Norse skyculture).\n"
"\n"
"The Sami sky culture does not have a large number of constellations. This is thought to be mainly because of the high Northerly latitude of the Sami people's range. Two factors contribute to this: that the Southern sky stays below the horizon to a large extent, and that the Aurora Borealis is frequently bright enough to obscure many stars.\n"
"\n"
"### Notes\n"
"\n"
" 1. <a name=\"note1\"/>The exact star which represents *Galla* is uncertain. it is probably Procyon, Rigel or Sirius - Procyon was chosen as Galla for this sky culture since Sirius is very hard to spot from the latitude where the Sami live."

"Formerly known as the *Navigator Islands*, the Samoan archipelago has been "

"The Seri language (coiiqui'itom) forms part of the seriyumana family which means that, on one hand, its most recent relation can be given by the yumano coming from the north of the Californian peninsula, and, on the other hand, this language totally contrasts with the languages of its neighbouring nations who talk uto-aztec ones like pima, p&#225;pago, yaqui and mayo; all of them fila with a much more recent origin.\n"
"\n"
"The description of the Comca'ac (Seri) Constellations presented here comes from the book \"Bajo el cielo Comca'ac: Astronomía entre el mar y el desierto\", written by Arturo Morales Blanco, in which it is possible to identify the relations between sky, sea and desert, as they are recovered by oral tradition and family memories.\n"
"\n"
"This knowledge has arrived to us by oral transmission from generation to generation through time and shows how the events from the sea like the appearance of crabs or the abundance of Totoaba (a large fish, now in danger), comes along with the presence of sets of stars in the sky. Comca'ac people has named them Zaamth or Zix cam caoc'la, respectively; also, the coincidence of Pitahayas (cactus fruits) in the cactus with the appearance of constellation Hácosa (Corta-pitahayas) in the sky is very suggestive."

After six months, when the sea is cold, the crabs do not appear any more going from one place to another; instead the sea wheat, xnois, comes and their seed has been used to make flour and different food plates for centuries. The legend says that in the days corresponding to the crab \"harvesting\", it must be avoided to break a leg or a claw because, if this happens, the day after there will not be any more crabs at the site.</td>\n"

The forecast of this bad weather motivated their ancestors to go to the caves in the mountain and to go far from the beach. After the difficult days, around two months later, Comca'ac people returned to the beach carrying with them all the food and materials kept along: dried meat, fish, 'caguama' turtle, honey, and flour from 'péchita de mezquite' (seeds from Mesquite tree), between them.</td>\n"

Háap was wounded and flew through the sky bleeding; then, a little drop of blood fell in the Tiburón Island, and that is the reason why bura deer are native of the island.

"### Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"All this knowledge of Comca'ac people comes from prehispanic epoch, and it has prevailed through centuries, thanks to oral tradition and the strength of the community to colonization, at first, and his opposition to evangelization, later on. Still today, it is possible to hear the stories and legends behind the naming of constellations and the events on the sea and on the desert. With the recovery of these legends, by exercise of memory and lively events with his ancestors, Arturo Morales Blanco gave us a legacy that must be conserved for future generations: children, young people who will keep in their own language how and what to look for in the sky."

" The Men Tsee Khang Institute for Astro and Medicine in Lhasa, TAR, is the central authority for traditional Tibetan medicine and astrology, two fields of research which are closely related in Tibetan tradition. The institute is in charge of editing the annual Tibetan calendar. Although this can be described algorithmically, in 2009 Men Tsee Khang experts have re-erected a calendar observatory in Stag Phu monastery, where a sunrise observation is performed on each March 17th for calibrating the calendar. On this day, just as the sun climbs over a mountain ridge, its first rays are cast through a window in the observatory tower onto a particular rock which has been embedded into a circular platform.\n"

The same figures are also laid out in cement with bright stones connected by black lines in the circular platform which has been erected when the observatory was rebuilt.

Actually, one of the *gyukars* consists of 2 asterisms, therefore 28 *lunar asterisms* are named.\n"

"The star figures for Lunar Mansions in this skyculture are shown as asterisms among the traditional 12 Ptolemaic zodiacal constellations. It is assumed that most originate from the Indian traditions, esp. Kalacakra Tantra, but it appears that some Chinese influence is also present, e.g. Nr. 11. Only for the Zodiacal constellations artwork is provided. A few more constellations in Ptolemaic tradition are displayed in the northern sky to allow easier orientation, but with their names suppressed. We have no information about their names, relevance or even publicity of these in Tibet.\n"
"\n"
"### Please help us\n"
"\n"
"The figures are my own attempt of identification of the Lunar mansion figures. We can be sure about the placement of only those which can also be found in other sky cultures, e.g. Japanese Moon Stations which stem from Chinese tradition. Many stars are rather dim, and the figures in the emblem apparently have to be rotated in arbitrary ways, like *gyukar 3*=Hyades. Others require considerable liberties to accept a topological match. Alternative matches with stars in similar topology arranged in the orientation shown in the emblem (north=outer circle) have been found only in neighboring areas of the sky, making a match rather unlikely. Others appear to have been taken over from Chinese tradition, e.g. Nr. 11. LM21 can be explained only if we accept two separate figures which are not aligned as shown in the concrete figure. Then they represent Chinese constellations *Ox* and *Girl* (which is also Japanese Lunar station *Woman*).\n"
"\n"
"Alternative figures can be found in the old configuration files. We would like to hear from experts of Tibetan astronomy about both confirmed and corrected identification.\n"
"\n"
"The *zodiac* and *gyukar* bands have been taken over from Indian tradition. The link \"Spica=180°\" is also set here for both circles, but should be confirmed. \n"

"Tikuna territory encompasses a region 600 kilometers long, running west to east from the Chimbote region in Peru—along the emptiness of the Amazonas-Solimões valley, in the so-called Trapézio Amazônico (Colombian Amazonian Trapezoid)—to the Barreira da Missão region, in the municipality of Tefé, in the Brazilian state of Amazonas (See The Ticuna Atlas, Figure I).\n"

"\n"
" <em>Figure 1: The Tikuna Atlas<cite id=\"cit1a\">[**<sup>1</sup>**](#cit1)</cite> </em>\n"
"\n"
"The agencies and researchers that deal with them estimate that more than 53,544 (Siasi/Sesai, 2014) Tikunas live in Brazil (FUNASA, 2009), 8.000 in Colombia (Goulard, 2010), and 6.982 in Peru (INEL, 2007)<cite id=\"cit2a\">[**<sup>2</sup>**](#cit2)</cite>. Together, they constitute the largest Amazonian indigenous population. Aside from their own Tikuna language, they also speak Spanish and Portuguese, depending on whether they live in Colombia and Peru or in Brazil.\n"
"\n"
"The Tikuna live in riverside villages along the Amazonas-Solimões and its tributaries, called igarapés. Their daily life revolve around the cultivation cycles of different agricultural goods; specially, manioc, used to produce the flour the Tikuna sell in the markets of the region’s main cities. They are also fishers, hunters, and gatherers of the forest products. The women make hammocks, bags, and other objects with plant fibers; and the men paint on tururi fiber and fabricate arrows, paddles, and canoes.\n"
"\n"
"It should be noted that, in Brazil, the Tikuna Indians live in indigenous lands recognized by Brazil’s indigenous policy. They are located in “terrestrial islands” among non-indigenous territories occupied by the Brazilian Population, from Tabatinga to Manaus (as illustrated in the Brazilian Tikuna Atlas).\n"
"\n"
"### The Astronomical Correlations\n"
"\n"
"The movements of the Tikuna constellations correspond to an interpretation of the seasonality of rainfall, as the Tikuna narratives suggest. These constellations are related to myths referencing the ascension and fall of Wücütcha (a heavenly beast related to the Jaguar Clan), Coyatchicüra (Caiman’s Jaw) and Baweta (Tracajá, the Aquatic Turtle Collective), the Anteater’s fight with the Jaguar, and the Way of the Tapir.\n"
"\n"
"According to the testimony of the Tikuna indigenous people, Baweta (the Pleiades Star Cluster) appears in the eastern sky towards the end of November, at nightfall. After Baweta rises, Caiman’s Jaw rises. Wücütcha’s leg corresponds to a portion of The Orion Constellation; and it begins to disappear from the western sky around the 20th of May, at nightfall. About one month earlier, the Caiman’s Jaw, corresponding to The Hyades Star Cluster in Taurus, also disappears to the West.\n"
"\n"
"According to Vieira’s interpretation, the form of Baweta (the Turtle Collective) is associated with the stars within the asterisms of the Pleiades and of Perseus. Baweta’s eyes are the feet of Perseus (Omicron Persei - Atik and ζ (Zeta) Persei). The “V” shape that Western astronomy relates to the head of Taurus is called Coyatchicüra (Caiman’s Jaw). Wücütcha’s Leg corresponds to the stars that groups as Orion. Its toes are Orion’s Belt and the bend of the legs are ι (iota) Orionis; κ (kappa) Orionis; η (eta) Leporis and δ (delta) Leporis.\n"
"\n"
"During the summer, the fight between the Anteater (Tchatü) and the Jaguar (Ai) occurs. The end of the battle coincides with the death and ascension of Wücütcha. The eyes of the Anteater are located in β (beta) of Triangulum Australe; his claw and body is in the constellations Norma and Ara. The right foot of the Jaguar is in Scorpio’s α (Antares), σ (Sigma), and τ (tau); its eyes are in ε (epsilon) and μ (mu) Scorpii; and its left paw is in λ (Shaula), υ (upsilon Sco – Lesath) and κ (kappa) of the same constellation. Wücütcha (the Jaguar’s leg) represents the beginning of the rains in late September; and its reappearance to the east follows the setting of Tchatü in the west, at nightfall, in the end of November. Those correlations are illuminated by indigenous testimony reproduced below:\n"
"\n"
"> “The stars fit into their respective constellations. First is Wücütcha. After winter, summer begins to walk. It is the Jaguar. After him, comes Coyathicüra in the month of May, at nightfall, when the Caiman’s Jaw appears on the beach. Baweta appears in September, the month of the turtle. In May, Wücütcha and Coyatchicüra fall. They all fall together at the end of May. In July, they come again. Baweta already begins to appear in July. When Wücütcha falls, beginning in May, caimans and turtles begin to appear. The apex is in September.”\n"
">\n"
"> “In May, all the constellations fall, together with their planets. It is summertime. Later, in July, they appear again for the New Year. Coya and Wücütcha leave the sky from May to September. Later, in July, they appear again.”\n"
">\n"
"> Fernando Marques or Ütchancu – translated by Lucho\n"
"\n"
"The Tikuna interpret processes affected by a succession of meteorological changes that, in turn, determine the rainy and the dry seasons. In this region of Western Amazon, the rainy season runs from December to March and the dry season from June to September. During April, May, October, and November the rainfall is intermediate. In November, the water level starts to rise and in late December the tides occur. During the month of May, the water level drops until September, the peak of the drought. The periods of El Niño imply a rain deficit, causing the extreme drought of the great river; during La Niña, the cooling of the Pacific increases the amount of water, causing dramatic tides and floods.\n"
"\n"
"Although dependent on weather variability, at the September Equinox the Tikuna observe how fog affects how they see in early morning; the Pleiades star cluster disappears on the morning horizon in early June and reappears in the evening, in late November. The goal of the Tikuna is to predict the intensity of the coming rains in order to negotiate with the entity Mawü, the “Master of Rain,” the effects of the floods on their subsistence activities.\n"
"\n"
"According to the explanations found in Enepü (a Tikuna community in the indigenous Land Eware II, in the Brazilian State of Amazon, in Western Amazonia), the influence of seasonality upon Tikuna subsistence activities is more prevalent along the Solimões. In the headwaters of the igarapés, where Enepü is situated, plenty of food exists all year long. In Enepü, trees and palms, such as the ingá and açaí, are fertile all year long due to the “virginity” and the enrichment of the soil by natural compost. The same thing occurs with the fishing in Lake Preto, within the limits of Enepü, where they can supply themselves abundantly with fish all year long. On the Solimões, however, one finds fish only from April to July, when the water level drops. Abundance in the hunt is also from April to July (or September, at most), along the Solimões. Fishing becomes more difficult when the river is high. The fruit of the native açaí palm is collected in summer, and customarily saved for preparation during winter—time of poor hunting and fishing. Through planning and regular gardening, harvests are available all year long. The harvest of cultivated plants also occurs during the drought months. There is a certain degree of flexibility in adapting the agricultural calendar to the rainy season (when fishing and hunting are not productive) and the dry season, (when fishing is more abundant); however, difficulties involving navigation and transport grow as the water level drops along the igarapés linking the river. Traditional culture, however, is not prepared for unforeseen alterations in the rainy season, such as it occurred in 2002. In that year, July saw the beginning of the repiquete (the rise on water levels), which normally occurs in September. This destroyed the short-range agricultural cycle and made the fish scarcer, changing alimentary habits.\n"

"**Fernando Vieira** (Astronomer and Former Coordinator of Astronomy in The Planetarium Foundation of the City of Rio de Janeiro) helped with the interpretation of the astronomical correlations between Western and Tikuna constellations, identified by the Tikuna in November 2002, during a research visit at the Science Center and Planetarium of the Universidade do Pará (Belém/Brazil), using the Starry Night System. Vieira plotted the correspondence between the traces of Tikuna mythical animals and the Official IAU constellations of western astronomy. He also reviewed this text for any skyscape incongruences related to corresponding Western astronomy and Tikuna cosmovision.\n"
"\n"
"We are integrating in this investigation **Walmir Thomazi Cardoso**, a Physics Professor in the Postgraduate Program in History of Sciences and Techniques and Epistemology at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (HCTE-UFRJ) and researcher of astronomy in culture; he made some reinterpretations in a collaborative work with physics undergraduate students; and **Youssif Ghantous Filho**, adapting and anchoring original drawings to Stellarium. Nevertheless, every sky interpretation is contextual and circumstantial. Current collaborative investigations are looking for new astronomical observation together with the Tikuna, which will improve the initial findings.\n"
"\n"
" The data used in **Cardoso & Ghantous Filho** were a reinterpretation of charts used by the Tikunas, **Pedro Inácio Pinheiro** and **Luís Angel Ramos**, to interpret Tikuna constellations. The calculations were established based upon coordinates 70° W and 3°S with the help of Oswaldo dos Santos Barros, Pará State (CCPP). The different interpretations of the drawings developed from the ongoing collaborative investigation with Walmir T. Cardoso, researcher of astronomy in Culture, takes into consideration some changes, such as the ones shown in this work.   **Marcio D´Olne Campos** (UNICAMP and SULear/SOUTHing Proposal) helped map the location of the Tikuna village and define their latitude and longitude coordinates (See Tikuna Lands Atlas).\n"

"In some circumstances separation of individual star names from &quot;star path&quot; names cannot be resolved. A star may have multiple names 1) if the star is part of numerous star paths and 2) since the naming of stars can differ depending on which Tongan island group it originates from. The nomenclature of stars is approximated based on the limited resources available.\n"
"\n"
"Whilst the most-notable/common stars and constellations (i.e. Orion, Pleiades, Crux) are identified in Tongan star lore there are two notable exceptions. There is an absence of naming of the North star (Polaris: &alpha; UMi). This is peculiar considering the latitude of the Tongan islands and the prominence of this star at certain times of the year. In the event of any northerly journeys from Tonga such an important navigational landmark could not have possibly gone unnoticed. The constellation of Scorpio (parts in, or stars of) are also absent from Tongan star lore. This is surprising since the vast majority of star lore &ndash; globally and Polynesian &ndash; has Scorpio as a central constellation due to it being easily identified and that it is nearly directly opposite Orion in the night sky. [Stellarium would welcome any further knowledge on these two anomalies.]\n"
"\n"
"Common ancestry of Polynesian star lore's is evident in the similarities in the labelling of stars. For example the Pleiades is called Mataliki in Tongan, Matariki in Maori and Makali`i in Hawaiian.\n"

"### Constellations\n"
"\n"
"Constellations within Tukano astronomical culture are related with natural phenomena as a whole. We gathered twelve constellations with a group who speaks Tukano language. This is not the definitive number of constellations. There are, surely, more constellations to be described. We presented here essentially “the main cycle” (CARDOSO, 2007) of the Tukano constellations. Sometimes someone relate new discoveries about these Indians sky conceptions or presents new constellation descriptions. Though we are establishing limits and configurations to these constellations that are new to us (non- Indians), they don’t organize this body of knowledge in the same way. Their conceptions about sky and Universe are different when compared with ours. They don’t organize and conceive ideas about the Universe as a whole, like us.\n"
"\n"
"Hereby we present few data from a research carried out with living people and this data may be variable in near future. We worked with basic school students, elders and story tellers comparing the talks and summarizing it as you’ll see below.\n"
"\n"
"In general, we can say that a Tukano constellation, or parts of it, are observed when its setting occurs, like the sunset (heliacal setting) during the short period of an year. There are an amount of natural phenomena related with this astronomical event. For example we can consider Aña’s head setting during November and its relation with the increase and decrease of the Tiquié river level. The variation of the river level is accompanied with an emerging of different fishes which appear as the result of these changeable natural conditions. Other larger fishes follow the first group for multiple purposes (eating smaller ones for example). All of them eat some fruits which eventually fall over the river surface. Ground animals and microorganisms are interested on these fruits, as well as either. So, a phenomenon first described as an astronomical set for us can be seen inside a more complex behavior for Tukanos and their neighbors around this region. Animals, plants and also spiritual manifestations are in a complex relationship under the cosmological view that we can’t more ignore.\n"

"#### SOME WORDS ABOUT OUR RESEARCH WITHIN NORTWESTERN AMAZONIAN INDIANS\n"
"\n"
"This work is part of an amount of researches developed as a survey, conducted between 2005 and 2007 that resulted in a doctoral/PhD thesis (Cardoso, 2007). Relying on Ethnomatematics sources (D’ambrosio, 2002), in practical sky observation activities and on classical sources about constellations observed in Brazil’s Amazon region, we accomplished a sky mapping of these Indian ethnicity: Tukano, Dessano and Tuyuka but in special, the first one. From the description of many constellations we created an astronomical events and climate calendar along with students from differentiated Yupuri’s indigenous school. Rain periods, drought, planting and harvesting are marked by the sunset and sunrise of the major constellations created by Amazonia northwest Indians.\n"

"##### isiLimela &mdash; Pleiades\n"
"\n"
"The first sighting of &#8220;isiLimela&#8221; indicated the start of the Xhosa digging or planting season. It is also said that the month of the Digging Stars symbolised new life in a man for the coming-out ceremony of the Abakwetha circumcision school and it has always been a custom for Xhosa men to count their years of manhood from this time.\n"
"\n"
"##### iQhawe &mdash; Sirius\n"
"\n"
"Sirius is known as &#8220;iQhawe&#8221; in Xhosa, which means &#8220;the champion&#8221;, probably because it is the brightest star in the night sky. It can also be seen as one of two suitors or rivals (along with Canopus, the second brightest star), but we cannot say for whose affections they are fighting.\n"
"\n"
"##### uCanzibe &mdash; Canopus\n"
"\n"
"Canopus is the second brightest star in the heavens and is referred to as &#8220;uCanzibe&#8221; in Xhosa, which means shining and sparkling. The star is seen as traditional Xhosa boys dancing, or sometimes as one of two suitors (Sirius, the brightest star, being the other), possibly rivals in their quest for affection.\n"
"\n"
"##### umNyele &mdash; The Milky Way\n"
"\n"
"&#8220;umNyele&#8221; is the Xhosa for the raised bristles along the back of the sky, like those on the back of an angry dog. It was told that the dog would rise up if you point to the heaven with straight fingers. This was a good deterrence and the people would remember to show respect for the god &#8220;Qamata&#8221; by always pointing to the sky with a bent finger.\n"

"\n"
"In Xhosa the three stars of Orion&#8217;s Belt are known as the &#8220;amaKroza&#8221;, or &#8220;those in a queue&#8221;.

"##### isiLimela &mdash; Pleiades\n"
"\n"
"The Pleiades is a well-known cluster of stars, and normally six or seven bright ones can be seen. Many of the Southern African groups believe that when they first see the Pleiades in the early morning (August or early September), that the start of the planting season has come.\n"
"\n"
"##### oNdwenjana &mdash; Orion&#8217;s Sword\n"
"\n"
"One of the descriptions of Orion&#8217;s Sword is as a long-stemmed flower, such as a lily. However the meaning of this group of stars isn't completely clear, because &#8220;oNdwenjana&#8221; could also be another tall object like a tree or a man.\n"
"\n"
"##### Impanbana &mdash; Orion&#8217;s Belt\n"
"\n"
"Orion&#8217;s Belt is a combination of a crossing, dogs and wild hogs. Seeing the stars of Orion&#8217;s Belt reminded hunters to be very careful during their hunting trips, as it marked the mating season of the wild hogs.\n"
"\n"
"##### isAndulela &mdash; Canopus\n"
"\n"
"Canopus is a bright star that appeared at harvest time and might also be connected to the Red-chested Cuckoo. It was also used as a guide for shepherds, marking the time to begin the journey to new grazing lands during the dry season.\n"
"\n"
"##### Umthala Wezinkanyezi &mdash; The Milky Way\n"
"\n"
"Umthala Wezinkanyezi means &#8220;the stream of stars.&#8221; This is related to the way the Nguni people used to fight before Shaka Zulu&#8217;s revolutionary close-combat strategy. The strong warriors used to throw spears like javelin and the stream of spears would be seen in the air."
