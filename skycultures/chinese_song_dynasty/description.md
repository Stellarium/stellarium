# Chinese Song Dynasty Sky

## Introduction

This sky culture is based on the observation data from the 4th year of the Huangyou era (1052 AD), and aims to faithfully reconstruct the star map of China during the Song Dynasty. This sky culture comprises 283 Xingguans (星官, Chinese Constellations) and 1464 stars (including clusters M7, M44) from the *Xinyixiangfayao Star Map*. A determinative star has been identified and marked for each Xingguan where possible. The boundaries of the Twenty-eight Lunar Mansions are delineated according to the standards of 1052 AD.

## Description

###  Xingguan System

The Chinese system of Xingguans originated in antiquity. During the Warring States period (475–221 BC), astronomers Gan De (甘德) and Shi Shen (石申) established independent systems. Another system was attributed to the legendary figure Wuxian (巫咸) of the Shang Dynasty  (16th century BC–1046 BC), though modern scholarship suggests it was likely compiled by later generations in his name. In the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD), astronomer Chen Zhuo (陈卓) synthesized these three systems into a unified one, defining 283 Xingguans and 1464 stars. This framework became the standard and was later immortalized in the *Song of the Sky Pacers (步天歌)*, a Tang Dynasty astronomical text written in verse. It remained largely unchanged until the introduction of Western astronomy in the 17th century.

A central concept within this system is the *determinative star*. Before the 17th century, Chinese astronomers generally did not assign names to individual stars; instead, they designated a primary star—though not necessarily the brightest—within each Xingguan as its determinative star. Astronomical observations primarily documented the coordinates of these determinative stars, though in particularly important or special Xingguans, additional stars could also be selected for observation and recording, or even assigned names.

**The determinative stars of the Twenty-eight Lunar Mansions were of particular importance, forming—together with the North Celestial Pole—the fundamental reference framework for the ancient Chinese equatorial coordinate system.** 

In ancient China, astronomers employed two key measurements to locate stars:

- **Mansion Entry Degree** , defined as the difference in right ascension between the target object and the determinative star of its host lunar mansion, and  
- **Polar Distance Degree** , defined as the angular distance between the object and the North Celestial Pole.

### Restore Sky Map

The Royal Observatory of the Song Dynasty conducted several large-scale stellar observations with remarkable accuracy, surpassing all previous eras in precision. The data from 1052 AD is the most complete set that survives today. Based on these records, two significant star charts were produced: the Xinyixiangfayao Star Map (1088 AD) and the Suzhou Stone Star Map (1247 AD).

The historian of astronomy Pan Nai (潘鼐) systematically compiled this observational data into the *Huangyou Star Catalog*. By cross-referencing it with the *Xinyixiangfayao Star Map* in his work *The History of Stellar Observation in China*, he reconstructed most of the Song Dynasty constellations, serving as the primary reference for this project.

In their work *Roving China Heavens*, Qi Rui (齐锐) and Wan Haoyi (万昊宜) also accomplished a restoration based on the *Suzhou Star Map*, making it another essential reference.

Due to the limitations of observational technology and potential errors in transmission, different scholarly reconstructions may vary slightly. Based on the aforementioned works, Stellarium faithfully reconstructs the Chinese night sky of 1052 AD.

### Planets

Great Yang (太阳, Tàiyáng): The Sun. In Chinese philosophy, it represents the pinnacle of Yang energy.

Great Yin (太阴, Tàiyīn): The Moon. It represents the pinnacle of Yin energy.

Division Star (辰星, Chénxīng): Refers to Mercury. Since Mercury always moves within 30 degrees on either side of the Sun, the angular unit *Chen* was defined accordingly, representing approximately 30 degrees. The celestial circle is divided into twelve *Chen*. Hence, Mercury came to be called the *Division Star*.

Grand White (太白, Tàibái): Venus. It is named for its extremely high brightness and pure white color.

Spark-Weaver (荧惑, Yínghuò): Mars. It is named for its fiery red color and its erratic, unpredictable orbit.

Year Star (岁星, Suìxīng): Jupiter. Jupiter's orbital period of approximately 12 years was used by the ancients to mark the cycle of years, hence its name.

Stabilizer Star (填星, Zhènxīng): Saturn. In traditional theory, Saturn was believed to take about 28 years to orbit the heavens, *guarding* or *filling* one lunar mansion each year.
