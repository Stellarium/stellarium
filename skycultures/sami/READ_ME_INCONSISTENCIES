There are several inconsistencies in this sky culture:
- the star Vega is identified in the description file as both the Runner and
the Morning Star
- at the same time, the constellation labels identify Altair as the Morning
Star
- the only other source on Sami ethnoastronomy I could find online,
http://www.starlab.com/PDFs/D.14.Lapp-SamiMythology.pdf , lists Venus as the
Morning and Evening star
- the same source also provides a different form/transcription of the Hunter's
name (here: Favdna, there: Favnta).
- there's also an uclear sentence about the Milky Way
("...as connect to the seasons.")

I can comment on this. The Sami sky cultures are not uniform and exist in at least 3 different regional versions. 
The description is based on a merger of these as it is not possible to construct three different, due to lack of information.
It is not unusual to have dual meanings for celestial objects.

Since the Sami languages are part of the finnish-ugric language family transcriptions differ depending on the land of origin of the interpreter.
A Swede like myself would use a soft d in Favdna, while a native English speaker would use the harder t.

I can not answer the text on the Milky Way other that it is only visible in winter, late autumn and early spring in Sampi.
So a coupling with migrating birds can be explained. The position in the sky as I suspect Starlab try to convey can be used as a crude time determination.
I have seen a passage in one of the Norse sagas that indicates a similar use in Iceland/Norway.
