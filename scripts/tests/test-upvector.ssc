// Name: Up vector test
// Author: Georg Zotti
// License: Public Domain
// Description: This script tests a move by the script command 
// core.moveToAltAzi(90,180,1), i.e., a move within 1 second 
// towards 90 degrees altitude (zenith), with south at the screen bottom.
// This move is dangerous as the view UP vector would usually fall parallel 
// to the view direction vector, causing either black screen or orientation disorder.
// The mitigation is storing the final UP vector when the move is set up and setting it 
// explicitly at the end of the move.

// Run these tests by marking single lines!

core.moveToAltAzi(90, 180, 1);

core.moveToRaDec("12h", "90", 2);
