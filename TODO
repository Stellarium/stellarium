Stellarium TODO list :

Stop using the glpng library which is the cause of bugs and which is not very portable.
Need to make stellarium own texture loader using for example SDL_image library.

Important features :
* Use jpg format instead of png.
* Selection of any object available in a list.
    - need the implementation of the widget "list" in gui.
* Reduce the program size by reducing the stellplanet library size, especially the moon coefficents file.

Features :
* More nebulas.
* More landscapes skins.
* Minor planets

Other cool features :
* Artificial satellites
* Shooting star and meteor shower
* Northern Lights
* Using real 3D landscape with data taken from the site http://www.megginson.com/flightsim/fgfs-vmap0/
