"The Book of Fixed Stars was written shortly before 964 AD. Dr. Paul "
"Kunitzsch described it as \"the most outstanding among the works of the "
"prominent astronomer Abu 'l-Ḥusayn 'Abd al-Raḥmān ibn 'Umar al-Şūfi (born in"
" Rayy, 903; died 986), referred to as al-Sufi. In it, al-Şūfī treats the 48 "
"classical constellations, which were established and transmitted in "
"Ptolemy's Almagest. The description of each constellation comprises the "
"following four sections: first, a general discussion of the constellation "
"and its individual stars; this section also includes alŞūfi's criticism of "
"the Ptolemaic tradition and notices of his own observations. Second, a "
"record of the indigenous Arabic star names falling under that constellation,"
" and the exact identification of the respective stars with the corresponding"
" Ptolemaic stars. Third, two drawings of the constellation, one as it is "
"seen on a celestial globe, and the other one as it is seen in the sky. "
"Fourth, a table of the stars making up that constellation, giving a verbal "
"description of each star's location and its longitude, latitude, and "
"magnitude. This table closely follows the arrangement of Ptolemy's star "
"catalogue in the Almagest.\" <sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">[1]</a></sup>. In "
"addition to the four sections of each constellation mentioned by dr. "
"Kunitzsch, Al-Sufi would identify stars within the 6 magnitudes that were "
"neglected by Ptolemy, but he did not catalogue them and was faithful to "
"Ptolemy star catalog."

"An important aspect of the general discussion section is Al-Sufi method of "
"facilitating the star identification. He describes each individual star in "
"more than way: By the star position related to the constellation figure, by "
"its magnitude, by the asterism it forms with other stars like triangle or "
"arc shapes, sometimes by the star position related to the Milky way, and by "
"the angular distance from a close by star. I have counted more than 700 "
"angular distances measured by al-Sufi in his book. The units he uses for "
"angular distances are cubits, spear length, man-height, span, and finger. "
"Al-Sufi explicitly said in his book that a cubit is equal to two degrees and"
" 20 minutes <sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\">[2]</a></sup>. For the other units,"
" Schjellerup concluded some values, but tracking the 700 measurements, I "
"came up with different values. The following table summarizes the units and "
"relationship to the cubit value from Schjellerup<sup><a "
"href=\"#footnote-3\">[3]</a></sup> and from my research."

"The <em>Lokono</em>, also known as <em>Arawak</em>, are an indigenous people"

"Ocean, from northwestern Guyana, through Suriname, to northwestern French "
"Guiana (see map).<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">[1]</a></sup> The Lokono speak"
" a language that belongs to the Arawakan language family&mdash;one of the "

" relatives, the Lokono are agriculturalists specializing in the farming of "
"manioc (<em>Manihot esculenta</em>), who also practice fishing, hunting, and"
" gathering of wild plant. However, as one of the first indigenous groups "

"have been in contact with non-indigenous populations for over 500 "
"years.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\">[2]</a></sup> This contact has "
"intensified in the last century, leading to a substantial loss of the Lokono"
" language, traditional material and immaterial culture, changes in "
"subsistence practices, and in particular to the disappearance of <em"
">medicine-men</em>&mdash;the traditional carriers of spiritual knowledge, "
"most likely including ethnoastronomical knowledge. As a consequence, the "
"modern knowledge about celestial bodies appears to be but a fraction of what"
" the Lokono knew about stars in the past. Several constellations mentioned "
"in older sources are forgotten or are only known from their names, while the"
" combinations of stars they represent and the oral traditions explaining "
"their origin and significance have been forgotten. The Skyculture presented "
"here includes only identified constellations but the following description "

"The term <em>koya</em> &lsquo;spirit&rsquo;, found in numerous constellation"

" feature of Lokono astronomy. Walter Roth, an ethnographer of the Guianas, "
"explains that such constellations are the spirits of the corresponding "
"beings.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\">[4]</a></sup> At a time of the year when"
" the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to earth to "
"breathe life into the beings it represents. As such, the "
"<em>koya</em>-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best "
"time is to engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and "
"animals (e.g. hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where "
"such spirits would descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called "
"these places with the same names as the constellations but the evidence of "
"that remains poor. Thus, <em>Hadorhikoya</em> &lsquo;Spirit of the red "

"where the <em>hadorhi</em> is found in plenty when its constellation "

"Originally, Tibeto-Mongolian astrology calculates the positions of each of "

"A tradition, particularly delightful, concerns the link between Mongolian "
"people and the Great Bear as one star of this constellation is attributed to"
" each of them. It depends on their birth year in the Chinese calendar. "
"Chinese and Mongolian calendars have some similarities (the Mongolian "
"calendar is a lunar calendar). Each year is symbolized by an animal, itself "
"associated to a star of the constellation Great Bear. The first, Dubhe, "
"corresponds to the rat's year, the second, Merak, corresponds to the ox and "
"so on until the end of the Great Bear's tail where Alkaid symbolizes the "
"year of the horse. Then we come back to the first, the sheep year and we "
"repeat the same way until the twelfth and latest year of the Chinese "

"regard to the MUL.APIN version have certainly applied in the zodiac since "
"several centuries. This can be stated for sure because in this time, there "

"MUL.APIN and the zodiac developed around the middle of the -1st millennium, "
"in the 2nd half of the 1st millennium BCE, there had been different versions"
