Camera sensors are specified via their corners, which are assumed to form spherical
polygons.  The corners should be specified as gnomonic projections from the sphere to a
tangent plane in radians.  Multiple groups of sensors can compose the same camera.  For
example, LSSTCam has separate sensor groups for wavefront sensors, guider sensors, and
each of two types of science sensors.

Each camera is defined via a JSON file with the structure:

[
    {
        "camera_name": "telescope/camera full name",
        "camera_description": "telescope/camera description in HTML",
        "camera_url": "https://www.nasa.gov/"
    },
    {
        "name": "name-of-group-1",
        "corners": [
            [
                [corner1_x, corner1_y],
                [corner2_x, corner2_y],
                ...
            ], # sensor 1
            [
                ...
            ], # sensor 2
            ...
        ]
        "color": {
            "value": [R, G, B, alpha]
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "name-of-group-2",
        ...
    },
    ...
]

Cameras are loaded according to the order in

camera_order.json

which has the structure:
{
    "order": [
        "LSSTCam",
        "DECam",
        ...
    ]
}
