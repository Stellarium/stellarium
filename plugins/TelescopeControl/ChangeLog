[0.3.0]
Minor code cleanup.
Partial translation.
Fixed local IP connections not being recognized by the telescope configuration
window. (LP: #843837)

[0.2.4]
Use editable keybindings

[0.2.2]
?

[0.2.1]
Code cleanup and refactoring.
Changed the layout of the telescope configuration window.
Moved the "virtual telescope" option to a more prominent place.
Added version check for telescopes.json.
Fixed log file formatting.
Fixed the serial port validator on Linux/Mac OS X. (revision 6256)

[0.2.0]
Fixed OS defines (WIN32 -> Q_OS_WIN32, MACOSX -> Q_OS_MAC). (revison 5985, 5989)
Fixed a bug: telescope control sends RA=0 for objects with RA between
(12 and 24?) on Intel Macs. (revision 6025, fix proposed by David Hulse)
Changed tabs style to a more compact, more rounded look. (revision 6032)
Added two entries for Sky-Watcher in the device models list. (revision 6034)
Cleaned up log messages and telescope server loading logic. (revision 6036)
Expanded significantly the Help section. (revision 6057)
Renamed "FOV cirles" to "field of view indicators". (revision 6110)
Separate options for toggling reticles and FOV indicators. (revision 6110)
Added slewing to the current center of the viewport (Alt+[num]). (revision 6149)
Added a "Slew to" dialog, toggled with Alt+0. This solves the old problem
with hiding the main window when adding/configuring a telescope and lets the
toolbar button do something sensible. (revision 6153)

[0.1.9] (2010-01-26) (revision 5769)
Branched telescope server code to simplify building. (revision 5671)
Enabled logging for embedded telescope servers. (revision 5721)
Added two devices to device_models.json: the Argo Navis digital setting circle
and the Meade ETX70 with the slow Autostar controller. (revision 5739)
Fixed a bug: Closing the Telescope Configuration window with the Esc key
caused the main plug-in window to remain in a disabled state. (revision 5739)
Fixed a bug: Enabling/disabling telescope server executables after a telescope
had been started caused unpredicted behaviour. Now toggling the flag or
selecting a new directory stops all telescopes. (revision 5747)
More validation: The user-specified telescope server executables directory
should contain executables starting with "TelescopeServer". (revision 5748)
Added an option to toggle on/off telescope server logging. (revision 5752)
Added a mechanism to replace automatically the device models list
with the default version if the current copy is outdated. (revision 5752)
Fixed a bug: Embedded telescope servers did not work. (revisions 5747 and 5754)

[0.1.8] (2010-01-12) (revision 5640)
Fixed bug with selection marker. (revision 5407)
Added content to the "About" tab and renamed it to "Help". (revision 5603)
Propagated changes in texture creation from the main code. (revision 5613)

[0.1.7] (2009-11-10)
Interface changes:
- tabbed dialog;
- added Options tab;
- added About tab;
- added an option to enable/disable external telescope server executables;
- added an option to set the telescope server executables directory.
Added experimental support for embedded telescope servers for the Dummy,
Meade LX200 and Celestron NexStar devices.

[0.1.6] (2009-10-05)
Moved the custom stylesheets to files embedded as Qt resources. (rev. 5093-5094)
Modified the plug-in to conform to the Stellarium's new GUI paradigm. (r 5093)
Fixed a forgotten tooltip in TelescopeConfigurationDialog. (r 5109)

[0.1.5] (2009-09-30)
The telescope list alternate-background style is night mode compatible now.
Changed the layout of TelescopeConfigurationDialog, using a QToolBox to
contains most of the controls.
Reduced the number of use cases to two: an internally launched server and
a connection to external software or a remote computer.
Replaced the Serial Port QSpinBox with an editable QComboBox to allow greater
flexibility on Linux and to enable Mac users to use the plug-in. :)
The telescopes.json file of this version is not compatible with the previous
one, so clean your /modules/TelescopeControl directory.
This version hasn't been tested on Windows.

[0.1.4] (2009-09-29)
Fixed a crash when the telescope servers directory is missing.
Migrated to shared pointers: this fixes a crash when re-selecting
a telescope reticle in the Debug build. (Works OK in Release, that's why I
thought it had fixed itself.)
Found and fixed an old bug in TelescopeClient: non-polymorphic method made it
possible to initialize a client with an invalid host address.
The plug-in now unloads Stellarium's internal TelescopeMgr module.
Found and fixed a TelescopeClient bug on systems that use IPv6.
The size of TelescopeDialog is no longer fixed, it can be resized now.
Added a label to TelescopeDialog used to display warnings and tips.
Changed some text and tooltips in TelescopeConfigurationDialog.
Changed the layout and some of the behaviour of TelescopeConfigurationDialog:
device-specific controls are hidden instead of disabled.
Added a Doxyfile for generating documentation.

[0.1.3] (2009-09-23)
Minor interface tweaks.
Telescope labels' font size is now set in the configuration file.
Updated StelDialogTelescopeControl to revision 5047 of StelDialog.
Finished the basic abstraction layer and fixed the bug introduced in the
previous version. Now the device model name is used internally instead of the
telescope server name.
Renamed the BACKPORT mode to COMPATIBILITY_001003. (Yeah, I know.)

[0.1.2] (2009-09-22)
Finalized the renaming of the Telescope class to TelescopeClient.
TelescopeControl::listTelescopeServerExecutables() has been improved:
it returns only executables with names beginning with "TelescopeServer".
Fixed a bug leaving the "Configure" button disabled when a new telescope is
is added for the first time.
Added a rudimentary abstraction layer: The user now selects a device model
instead of directly selecting the telescope server. TODO: Use internally
the device model name instead of the server name. This will fix the behaviour of
the Configuration dialog for existing telescopes.

[0.1.1] (2009-09-21)
Minor interface tweaks. A tooltip explaining the "Delay" field has been added.
Cleaned up the code a little bit.
Added a few warnings and a bit more validation of the JSON data.
The behaviour of the "Configure" button is more intuitive now.
Fixed a crash caused by removing a telescope while it is selected
(as a Stellarium object, not as a row in the table).

[0.1.0] (2009-09-19)
Cleaned up the logic (and the code, but...)
Migrated active telescope settings to JSON format.
(And cluttered up the code in the process.)
Added an option to choose if a telescope should start/connect at startup.
(Before, all telescopes tried to connect at startup.)
Fixed a bug that caused new telescopes to be created at an already occupied slot
if there was no client created at that slot.

[0.0.7] (2009-09-16)
Fixed missing module folder crash.
Added platform-specific way of terminating a server process.
Workaround for the Windows Qt font rendering bug.
QFont::setPixelSize() accepts only integers.
The BACKPORT version is built by default now to avoid confusion.
Fixed the Windows dynamic loading issue ("Invalid access to memory location")
by copying the StelDialog class from Stellarium's main code, as advised
by Fabien Chereau.

[0.0.6] (2009-09-14)
Added code for static building. (Still trying to fix the Windows issue.)
Removed some leftover FreeType stuff.
Removed module configuration file module.ini from installation:
- module configuration is saved in the main configuration file;
- an empty module.ini file is created at runtime to store telescope data.
Modifications to telescope configuration dialog.
Fixed a telescope circles persistence bug.

[0.0.5] (2009-09-11)
Apple (Mac OS X) stuff copied from the AngleMeasure plug-in /CMakeLists.txt.
Code updated to conform to the new plug-in architecture in Stellarium 0.10.3.
Graphics files are now embedded in the binary.

[0.0.4]
Code handling communications over TCP was rewritten to use Qt classes instead
of system calls.
The Telescope class has been renamed (temporarily, I hope) to TelescopeClient
in order to resolve a conflict with the identically named class in Stellarium's
main code.

[0.0.3] (and before)
