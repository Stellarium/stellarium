	3.7 Naval Observatory Merged Astrometric Dataset (NOMAD) version 1
	    http://www.nofs.navy.mil/nomad
	    Norbert Zacharias writes:
	    "There are no fees, both UCAC and NOMAD are freely available
	    with the only requirement that the source of the data (U.S.
	    Naval Observatory) and original product name need to be provided
	    with any distribution, as well as a description about any
	    changes made to the data, if at all."
	    The changes made to the data are:
	    -) try to compute visual magnitude and color from the b,v,r
	       values
	    -) compute nr_of_measurements = the number of valid b,v,r values
	    -) throw away or keep stars (depending on magnitude,
	       nr_of_measurements, combination of flags, tycho2 number)
	    -) add all stars from Hipparcos (incl. component solutions), and
	       tycho2+1st supplement
	    -) reorganize the stars in several brigthness levels and
	       triangular zones according to position and magnitude
	    The programs that are used to generate the star files are called
	    "MakeCombinedCatalogue", "ParseHip", "ParseNomad", and can be
	    found in the util subdirectory in source code. The position,
	    magnitudes, and proper motions of the stars coming from NOMAD
	    are unchanged, except for a possible loss of precision,
	    especially in magnitude. When there is no v-magnitude, it is
	    estimated from r or b magnitude.  When there is no b- or v-
	    magnitude, the color B-V is estimated from the other magnitudes.
	    Also proper motions of faint stars are neglected at all.

2 License for the JPL planets images
(http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/policy/index.cfm)

    Unless otherwise noted, images and video on JPL public web sites (public
    sites ending with a jpl.nasa.gov address) may be used for any purpose
    without prior permission, subject to the special cases noted below.
    Publishers who wish to have authorization may print this page and retain
    it for their records; JPL does not issue image permissions on an image
    by image basis.  By electing to download the material from this web site
    the user agrees:
    1. that Caltech makes no representations or warranties with respect to
       ownership of copyrights in the images, and does not represent others
       who may claim to be authors or owners of copyright of any of the
       images, and makes no warranties as to the quality of the images.
       Caltech shall not be responsible for any loss or expenses resulting
       from the use of the images, and you release and hold Caltech harmless
       from all liability arising from such use.
    2. to use a credit line in connection with images. Unless otherwise
       noted in the caption information for an image, the credit line should
       be "Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech."
    3. that the endorsement of any product or service by Caltech, JPL or
       NASA must not be claimed or implied.
    Special Cases:
    * Prior written approval must be obtained to use the NASA insignia logo
      (the blue "meatball" insignia), the NASA logotype (the red "worm"
      logo) and the NASA seal. These images may not be used by persons who
      are not NASA employees or on products (including Web pages) that are
      not NASA sponsored. In addition, no image may be used to explicitly
      or implicitly suggest endorsement by NASA, JPL or Caltech of
      commercial goods or services. Requests to use NASA logos may be
      directed to Bert Ulrich, Public Services Division, NASA Headquarters,
      Code POS, Washington, DC 20546, telephone (202) 358-1713, fax (202)
      358-4331, email bert.ulrich@hq.nasa.gov.
    * Prior written approval must be obtained to use the JPL logo (stylized
      JPL letters in red or other colors). Requests to use the JPL logo may
      be directed to the Television/Imaging Team Leader, Media Relations
      Office, Mail Stop 186-120, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena CA
      91109, telephone (818) 354-5011, fax (818) 354-4537.
    * If an image includes an identifiable person, using the image for
      commercial purposes may infringe that person's right of privacy or
      publicity, and permission should be obtained from the person. NASA
      and JPL generally do not permit likenesses of current employees to
      appear on commercial products. For more information, consult the NASA
      and JPL points of contact listed above.
    * JPL/Caltech contractors and vendors who wish to use JPL images in
      advertising or public relation materials should direct requests to the
      Television/Imaging Team Leader, Media Relations Office, Mail Stop
      186-120, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena CA 91109, telephone
      (818) 354-5011, fax (818) 354-4537.
    * Some image and video materials on JPL public web sites are owned by
      organizations other than JPL or NASA. These owners have agreed to
      make their images and video available for journalistic, educational
      and personal uses, but restrictions are placed on commercial uses.
      To obtain permission for commercial use, contact the copyright owner
      listed in each image caption.  Ownership of images and video by
      parties other than JPL and NASA is noted in the caption material
      with each image.
