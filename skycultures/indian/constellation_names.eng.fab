## Note from the user guide at https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium/releases/download/v0.19.3/stellarium_user_guide-0.19.3-1.pdf :
#
# The native constellations are listed in constellation_names.eng.fab. It consists of 3 simple
# columns: Abbreviation(or just a serial number), native name, and english translation. 
# The writing _("name") allows automatic translation of the English strings to other languages. These strings will be used as constellation labels.
#
# The first column (abbreviation) in the Western sky culture provides the canonical 3-letter
# abbreviation for constellations as used by the International Astronomical Union. Such abbreviations
# may not be available for the skyculture you are working with, so you must invent your own. These
# abbreviations are used as keys in the other files, so they must be unique within your skyculture. It
# is not necessary to have 3-letter keys.
# The keys can be displayed on screen when labels are requested in the Starlore GUI (section
# 4.4.5). If you want to prevent certain abbreviations from being displayed, let them start with a
# dot. See the effect in the Western (H.A.Rey) skyculture: In Abbreviated mode, only the official
# abbreviations are displayed. In Native mode, the second column of constellation_names.eng.fab
# is shown. Only with setting Translated , the text translated from the text shown in the third column
# is shown. If your skyculture is a variant of the Western skyculture, please use the canonical Latin
# names, they have all been translated already.
# If your skyculture is not a variant of the generally known Western skyculture, please include an
# English translation to the name given in the native language. Else translators will not be able to
# translate the name
#################

# For the column 1: An abbreviation for the constellation. (The "abbreviated" mode should allow to use short unique markers, without filling the screen with text. In scientific context, the 88 IAU constellations are abbreviated with 3 characters, which is just enough to remember the constellation.)
# For the column 2: We use IAST transliteration for unambious transliteration of devanAgarI using latin alphabets, while using phonetically more intuitive equivalents in suggested translations.
# For column 3: We've referred to highly regarded sanskrit to sanskrit dictionaries kalpadruma and vAchaspatyam for etymologies below.

# Nakshatra-s.
#################
# We show Nakṣatra-s associated with a single star as a star, rather than as a constellation.
# From @gzotti: "if some Nakshatras may receive sky art, all Nakshatras should be coded as constellations. When we do the change mentioned above, those will then be separated (or just marked inside the constellation file). ... We may highlight the 1-star constellation in later editions e.g. by a circle."
