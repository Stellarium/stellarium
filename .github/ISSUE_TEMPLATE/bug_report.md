Before reporting an issue around graphics artifacts like missing menu buttons, strange colors, Moon not rendered, or similar, 
*please make absolutely sure* you are running the latest graphics drivers for your graphics card. 
95% of graphics problems are solved this way.

Before reporting an issue, please *absolutely make sure* to check the recent open and also closed issues 
(https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) 
whether it has been reported and solved/closed already! Don't report a new issue in this case, you may join the discussion.

Sometimes installing our almost weekly Beta version (i.e., the latest development version) helps: https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium-data/releases/tag/beta

Also look into the wiki https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium/wiki/Common-Problems-for-the-current-version 
and FAQ https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium/wiki/FAQ 
and check if you are attempting to report a known issue. Don't report in this case.

Also look into the User Guide before reporting unexpected but correct behaviour. Don't report in this case.
