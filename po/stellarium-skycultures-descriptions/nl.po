"The Book of Fixed Stars was written shortly before 964 AD. Dr. Paul "
"Kunitzsch described it as \"the most outstanding among the works of the "
"prominent astronomer Abu 'l-Ḥusayn 'Abd al-Raḥmān ibn 'Umar al-Şūfi (born in"
" Rayy, 903; died 986), referred to as al-Sufi. In it, al-Şūfī treats the 48 "
"classical constellations, which were established and transmitted in "
"Ptolemy's Almagest. The description of each constellation comprises the "
"following four sections: first, a general discussion of the constellation "
"and its individual stars; this section also includes alŞūfi's criticism of "
"the Ptolemaic tradition and notices of his own observations. Second, a "
"record of the indigenous Arabic star names falling under that constellation,"
" and the exact identification of the respective stars with the corresponding"
" Ptolemaic stars. Third, two drawings of the constellation, one as it is "
"seen on a celestial globe, and the other one as it is seen in the sky. "
"Fourth, a table of the stars making up that constellation, giving a verbal "
"description of each star's location and its longitude, latitude, and "
"magnitude. This table closely follows the arrangement of Ptolemy's star "
"catalogue in the Almagest.\" <sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">[1]</a></sup>. In "
"addition to the four sections of each constellation mentioned by dr. "
"Kunitzsch, Al-Sufi would identify stars within the 6 magnitudes that were "
"neglected by Ptolemy, but he did not catalogue them and was faithful to "
"Ptolemy star catalog."

"An important aspect of the general discussion section is Al-Sufi method of "
"facilitating the star identification. He describes each individual star in "
"more than way: By the star position related to the constellation figure, by "
"its magnitude, by the asterism it forms with other stars like triangle or "
"arc shapes, sometimes by the star position related to the Milky way, and by "
"the angular distance from a close by star. I have counted more than 700 "
"angular distances measured by al-Sufi in his book. The units he uses for "
"angular distances are cubits, spear length, man-height, span, and finger. "
"Al-Sufi explicitly said in his book that a cubit is equal to two degrees and"
" 20 minutes <sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\">[2]</a></sup>. For the other units,"
" Schjellerup concluded some values, but tracking the 700 measurements, I "
"came up with different values. The following table summarizes the units and "
"relationship to the cubit value from Schjellerup<sup><a "

"For the computation of planet positions Ptolemy used a geocentric model "

"Aristarch was not needed. However, for the star catalogue of the "

"proclaimed aim of the catalogue is to provide a list for making a celestial "
"globe (see Alm., VIII, 3). Being aware of precession he wants to ease the "
"business of future globemakers by using ecliptical coordinates: Precession "

" van de <i>Almagest</i> doet dit er helemaal niet toe, omdat een "

" lijst te produceren om een hemelglobe te maken (zie Alm., VIII, 3). Zich "
"bewust van de precessie wil hij het werk van toekomstige globemakers te "
"versimpelen door ecliptische coördinaten te gebruiken: Precessie zoals "
"bekend bij Ptolemaeus verschuift alle sterren parallel aan de ecliptica, "
"daarom kunnen updates van het tijdperk van de respectievelijke globemaker "

"One hundred and forty years ago, a Boorong family at Lake Tyrrell (North-"

"The knowledge of Hawaiian star navigation has been passed down orally for "
"many generations.   Much of the knowledge regarding stars and navigation "
"were lost until the Hawaiian Renaissance in the early 1970s.  Polynesian "
"Voyage Society (PVS), founded in 1973, created Hokule’a in 1975.  Hokule’a "
"is a traditional Hawaiian voyaging canoe with the mission to revive the art "
"of way finding.  A man from Satawal, Micronesia named Mau Piailug was a "
"master navigator/wayfinder.  The knowledge of wayfinding and using the sky "
"to navigate was passed down to Mau from his ancestors.  Nainoa Thompson, "
"current President of PVS, asked Mau to teach his knowledge of navigation to "
"him with the intention of reviving the knowledge that was once lost to the "
"Hawaiians.  With the knowledge learned from Mau, the Hawaiian star compass "
"and star lines were created."

"The term <em>koya</em> &lsquo;spirit&rsquo;, found in numerous constellation"

"explains that such constellations are the spirits of the corresponding "

" the constellation appears, the spirit travels from the sky to earth to "
"breathe life into the beings it represents. As such, the "
"<em>koya</em>-constellations formed a calendar, indicating what the best "
"time is to engage in subsistence activities related to these plants and "
"animals (e.g. hunting or gathering). The Lokono may have also known where "
"such spirits would descend on earth; Walter Roth suggests that they called "
"these places with the same names as the constellations but the evidence of "
"that remains poor. Thus, <em>Hadorhikoya</em> &lsquo;Spirit of the red "
"acouchi&rsquo; would refer to the spirit, the constellation, and the place "
"where the <em>hadorhi</em> is found in plenty when its constellation "
"appears. While this toponymic knowledge is forgotten today, the "

"De term <em>koya</em> &lsquo;geest&rsquo;, gevonden in talrijke sterrenbeeld"
" namen die doorgaans volgen op een term voor een bepaalde plant of dier, is "

"van de Guianas, legt uit dat dergelijke sterrenbeelden de geest zijn van de "
"overeenkomstige wezens.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\">[4]</a></sup> In een "
"tijd van het jaar waarin het sterrenbeeld verschijnt, reist de geest van de "

" zulke geesten op aarde zouden neerdalen; Walter Roth suggereert dat ze deze"
" plaatsen met dezelfde namen als de sterrenbeelden benoemden, maar het "
"bewijs daarvan blijft mager. Dus, <em>Hadorhikoya</em> &lsquo;Geest van de "

"While the Lokono can admire the sky in the evening, to follow the Lokono "
"stellar calendar, one has to look at the constellations around 4 am in the "
"morning, the time when the Lokono usually wake up. The Lokono thus observe "
"the rising of the constellations in the morning. To get the right idea of "
"the yearly cycle of constellations, one should also set the viewing location"
" to the Guianas (e.g. Georgetown, Paramaribo, or Cayenne in the location "
"menu). It merits a mention that many Lokono, when drawing constellations, "
"did not connect the stars with lines and that in some cases, there was "
"little agreement among speakers as to which star within a constellation "
"corresponds to which parts of the plant or animal it represents. In "
"Stellarium, we represent constellations with lines, but it should be kept in"
" mind that this may be a distortion of the Lokono tradition, which allows "
"for more flexibility in interpreting particular star groups. Finally, there "
"are restrictions on looking at some celestial bodies, since it is believed "
"that a spirit can harm one if looked at.<sup><a "

"Terwijl de Lokono de hemel 's avonds kan bewonderen, om de Lokono stellaire "
"kalender te volgen, moet je rond 4 uur 's ochtends naar de sterrenbeelden "
"kijken, de tijd dat de Lokono meestal wakker wordt. De Lokono observeren dus"
" de opkomst van de sterrenbeelden in de ochtend. Om het juiste idee te "
"krijgen van de jaarlijkse cyclus van sterrenbeelden, moet men ook de kijk "
"locatie instellen op de Guyana's (bijvoorbeeld Georgetown, Paramaribo of "
"Cayenne in het locatie menu). Het verdient een vermelding dat veel Lokono, "
"wanneer ze sterrenbeelden tekenen, de sterren niet met lijnen verbinden en "
"dat in sommige gevallen, er weinig overeenstemming was tussen de sprekers "
"over welke ster binnen een sterrenbeeld overeenkomt met welke delen van de "
"plant of dier dat het vertegenwoordigt. In Stellarium presenteren we "
"sterrenbeelden met lijnen, maar er moet rekening mee worden gehouden dat dit"
" een vervorming van de Lokono-traditie kan zijn, wat zorgt voor meer "
"flexibiliteit bij het interpreteren van bepaalde stergroepen. Ten slotte "
"zijn er beperkingen bij het bekijken van sommige hemellichamen, omdat men "
"gelooft dat een geest iemand kan schaden als er naar gekeken wordt.<sup><a "
"href=\"#footnote-5\">[5]</a></sup> Bijvoorbeeld, bij volle maan, bedekten de"
" moeders de ogen van hun kinderen zodat zij niet ziek zouden worden.<sup><a "

"te kijken naar <em>Y&ocirc;koro wiwa</em> (Plejaden), anders zouden zij niet"
" groeien.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7\">[7]</a></sup> Dergelijke praktijken "
"waren ook op andere voorwerpen van toepassing die worden verondersteld om "
"krachtige geesten te herbergen en omvatten andere manieren om oogcontact met"
" geesten zoals het wrijven pepers, kalk of zout in zijn ogen te vermijden."

"Chinese and Mongolian calendars have some similarities (the Mongolian "
"calendar is a lunar calendar). Each year is symbolized by an animal, itself "
"associated to a star of the constellation Great Bear. The first, Dubhe, "
"corresponds to the rat's year, the second, Merak, corresponds to the ox and "
"so on until the end of the Great Bear's tail where Alkaid symbolizes the "
"year of the horse. Then we come back to the first, the sheep year and we "
"repeat the same way until the twelfth and latest year of the Chinese "
"calendar, the one of the pig. Therefore, the two stars at the end of the "
"tail are assigned one time only."

"Een erg mooie traditie betreft de link tussen Mongoolse mensen en de Grote "
"Beer waar elk van hen aan een ster in dit sterrenbeeld wordt toegeschreven. "
"Het hangt af van hun geboortejaar in de Chinese kalender. Chinese en "
"Mongoolse kalenders hebben een aantal gelijkenissen (de Mongoolse kalender "
"is een maankalender). Elk jaar wordt gesymboliseerd door een dier, zelf "
"geassocieerd met een ster van het sterrenbeeld de Grote Beer. Het eerste "
"jaar, Dubhe, komt overeen met het jaar van de rat, de tweede, Merak, komt "
"overeen met de os en ga zo maar door tot het einde van de staart van de "
"Grote Beer waar Alkaid het jaar van het paard symboliseert. Dan gaan we "
"terug naar het eerste jaar, het schapenjaar en we herhalen dit op dezelfde "
"manier tot het twaalfde en laatste jaar van de Chinese kalender, die van het"
" varken. Daarom worden de twee sterren aan het einde van de staart slechts "
"één keer toegewezen."

" because it does not give a single coordinate and most of the names given "
"there are names of asterisms or constellations (and not point-like objects "
"such as stars). The text of this first list is reproduced below - yet, we "
"layouted it as a table to emphasis its function as an explanatory list. The "
"catalogue also includes the names of planets: of course, planets do not have"
" a fixed position.  However, in Mesopotamian culture it was common to "
"mention them for a complete set of objects in the sky.  They are usually "
"denoted (or drawn) at the position of their exaltation point (one of the "
"later Greek <em>hypsomata</em> - but Greek astrology provided two "
"<em>hypsomata</em> per planet while Babylonian had only one)."

"Deze luchtcultuur werd min of meer alleen gemaakt met de eerste lijst van "
"het compendium, de zogenaamde 'sterrencatalogus'. Het is geen echte "
"stercatalogus omdat het geen enkele coördinaat vermeld en de meeste namen "
"die worden vermeld zijn namen van asterismen of sterrenbeelden (en niet "
"puntachtige objecten zoals sterren). De tekst van deze eerste lijst is "
"hieronder weergegeven - maar toch hebben we het ingericht als een tabel om "
"de functie ervan als een verklarende lijst te benadrukken. De catalogus "
"bevat ook de namen van planeten: natuurlijk hebben planeten geen vaste "
"positie. Echter, in mesopotamische cultuur was het gebruikelijk om ze te "
"vermelden voor een complete set van objecten aan de hemel. Ze worden meestal"
" aangeduid (of getekend) op de positie van hun hoogte punt (een van de "
"latere Griekse <em>hypsomata</em> - maar de Griekse astrologie voorziet in "
"twee <em>hypsomata</em> per planeet, terwijl Babylonische slechts een had)."

"The names of the planets displayed in Stellarium are names of the objects in"
" the sky and not of the gods associated with them.  The list below shows "
"that almost every asterism was associated with a deity.  According to "
"Babylonian belief, a deity has two representations: one in the sky and one "
"on Earth as statue in the temple.  That means a celestial object `is' not "
"the deity but only one of its possible expressions. This is also the case "
"for the planets.  For instance, even a millennium before MUL.APIN, the "
"goddess of sexual love and desire as well as goddess of war, the Sumerian "
"Inanna/ Akkadian Ishtar had been associated with the planet Venus.  This "
"goddess was later `translated' to the Greek Aphrodite and Roman Venus and "
"even in the Greco-Roman culture the name of the planet was Phosphoros "
"(Greek: the Luminous One) or Lucifer (Latin: the Bringer of Light) but "
"associated with the goddess.  Similar cases exist for most of the "
"constellations and single stars listed in MUL.APIN."
msgstr ""
"De namen van de planeten weergegeven in Stellarium zijn namen van de "
"objecten aan de hemel en niet van de goden geassocieerd met ze. De "
"onderstaande lijst laat zien dat bijna elk asterisme werd geassocieerd met "
"een godheid. Volgens Babylonische overtuiging heeft een godheid twee "
"voorstellingen: een in de hemel en een op aarde als standbeeld in de tempel."
" Dat betekent dat een hemelobject 'niet de godheid is' maar slechts één van "
"zijn mogelijke uitdrukkingen. Dit is ook het geval met de planeten. "
"Bijvoorbeeld zelfs een millennium voor MUL.APIN, de godin van seksuele "
"liefde en verlangen, als ook godin van de oorlog, de sumerische Inanna / "
"Akkadische Ishtar werd geassocieerd met de planeet Venus. Deze godin werd "
"later 'vertaald' naar de Griekse Aphrodite en de Romeinse Venus en zelfs in "
"de Grieks-Romeinse cultuur was de naam van de planeet Phosphoros (Grieks: de"
" lichtgevende) of lucifer (Latijn: de brenger van het licht), maar "
"geassocieerd met de godin. Soortgelijke gevallen bestaan voor de meeste van "
"de sterrenbeelden en enkele sterren vermeld op de MUL.APIN."

"In general, we can say that a Tukano constellation, or parts of it, are "
"observed when its setting occurs, like the sunset (heliacal setting) during "
"the short period of an year. There are an amount of natural phenomena "
"related with this astronomical event. For example we can consider Aña’s head"
" setting during November and its relation with the increase and decrease of "
"the Tiquié river level. The variation of the river level is accompanied with"
" an emerging of different fishes which appear as the result of these "
"changeable natural conditions. Other larger fishes follow the first group "
"for multiple purposes (eating smaller ones for example). All of them eat "
"some fruits which eventually fall over the river surface. Ground animals and"
" microorganisms are interested on these fruits, as well as either.  So, a "
"phenomenon first described as an astronomical set for us can be seen inside "
"a more complex behavior for Tukanos and their neighbors around this region. "
"Animals, plants and also spiritual manifestations are in a complex "

"In het algemeen, kunnen we zeggen dat een Tukano sterrenbeeld, of delen er "
"van, zijn geobserveerd als ze onder gingen, zoals de zonsondergang (hemelse "
"ondergang) gedurende een korte periode in een jaar. Er zijn een aantal "
"natuurlijke fenomenen gerelateerd aan deze astronomische gebeurtenis. We "
"konden bijvoorbeeld concluderen dat de Aña’s hoofd ondergang in november is "
"gerelateerd met de toename en afname van het Tiquié rivierniveau. De "
"variatie van het rivierniveau gaat gepaard met de toename van verschillende "
"vissen die verschijnen als het resultaat van deze veranderlijke natuurlijke "
"omstandigheden. Andere grotere vissen volgen de eerste groep voor meerdere "
"doeleinden (eten bijvoorbeeld kleinere). Ze eten allemaal wat fruit dat "
"uiteindelijk over het rivieroppervlak wordt verspreid. Landdieren en micro-"
"organismen zijn weer geïnteresseerd in deze vruchten. Zo, een fenomeen eerst"
" beschreven als een astronomische ondergang voor ons, kan worden gezien in "
"een complexer gedrag voor Tukanos en hun buren in deze regio. Dieren, "
"planten en ook spirituele manifestaties bevinden zich in een complexe "
"relatie met de kosmologische visie die we niet meer kunnen negeren."
