Lower Austria, primary observing Spot of the Grossmugl Starlight Oasis near
Vienna.</p><p> Despite its vicinity to a large city, light pollution is concentrated mostly
on the southern horizon, and the Milky Way is well visible if a bit higher
in the sky. In the eastern horizon, red lights indicate a wind park also at
night.  <a href="http://starlightoasis.org">http://starlightoasis.org</a>.
