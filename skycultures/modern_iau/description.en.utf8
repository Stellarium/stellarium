<h1>Modern (IAU)</h1>
<p>The modern sky culture is used internationally by modern astronomers, 
and is the official scheme of The International Astronomical Union. 
It has historical roots in Ancient Greek astronomy, with influences from 
Islamic astronomy.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The modern sky culture divides the celestial sphere into 88 areas 
of various sizes called constellations, each with precise boundary, 
issued by the International Astronomical Union in 1922. These constellations 
have become the standard way to describe the sky, replacing similar sets 
in other sky cultures exhaustively in daily usage.</p>
<p>The constellations in use today are based mainly on ancient Greek 
constellations depicted by Ptolemy in his book the Almagest during the 
2nd century CE. In the subsequent centuries, this book has been translated 
from Greek into Arabic (6th to 9th century) and later to medieval Latin. 
In the Arabic more than in the Latin tradition, the Ptolemaic figures were 
enriched and transformed by native Arabic constellations and star names.</p>
<p>In the 16-18th centuries, European astronomers suggested new constellations 
to fill the gaps between northern constellations (e.g. the constellation 
of "the lynx" for an area close to the Great Bear but with stars so faint 
that you would need the eyes of a lynx to see them) and also created new 
constellations in the southern part of the sky which had not been visible 
to Ptolemy. These new constellations were usually named after new technical 
inventions of the early modern period (e.g. a chemical furnace, a balloon, 
an air pump) or exotic animals (e.g. a chamaeleon, a tucan, a paradise bird). 
Among them several constellations were also named with political consideration 
to honor certain kings or patrons.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the 20th century, the IAU (International Astronomical 
Union) aimed for a large clean-up: in 1922, it officially accepted the list 
of 88 constellation names. In 1928 it also defined precise constellation 
boundaries [#4] still in use today.</p>

<h3>Constellations</h3>
<p>These constellations are based mainly on the Ptolemaic tradition which 
had been used in all three Abrahamitic religions and, thus, was common in 
the Near East, in Europe and its colonies on all continents. However, between 
the ancient Greek constellations there were gaps of areas with only faint 
stars belonging to no constellation.[#5] In the Modern Epoch, several 
astronomers suggested constellation figures for these gaps, among them 
several political constellations to the honor of certain kings or patrons. 
In the late 19th century, the astronomical research community aimed for a 
huge clean-up to avoid ambiguities in assigning stars to constellations.</p>
<p>In 1922, the IAU officially approved the list of 88 constellation names 
and their official abbreviations with three letters. The only remaining 
political constellation is Scutum, the shield of a Polish king but without 
mentioning the political reference anymore. The Belgian priest E. Delporte 
got the task to define constellation boundaries according to coordinates. 
In 1928, he finished the work, based on an atlas from Argentina [#6], and 
the IAU accepted his delimitations [#4].</p>
<p>These "constellations" are naked areas in the sky without any stick 
figures or depictions [#1]. The borders simply follow the lines of right 
ascension and declination from the epoch 1875.0. Precession causes a slowly 
increasing deviation from the originally rectilinear grid. These 
constellations became the standard way to describe the sky, replacing 
similar sets in other sky cultures exhaustively in daily usage.</p>

<h4>Constellation Figures</h4>
<p>In star maps it is common to mark line "patterns" that represent the 
shapes that give the name to the constellations. However, the IAU defines 
a constellation by its boundary (indicated by sky coordinates) and not 
by its pattern and the same constellation may have several variants in 
its representation.</p>
<p>This sky culture uses constellation figures were produced in 
collaboration with "Sky and Telescope" magazine (Roger Sinnott and Rick 
Fienberg) and published at IAU official website [#1]. Alan MacRobert's 
constellation patterns, were influenced by those of H. A. Rey but in many 
cases were adjusted to preserve earlier traditions.</p>

<h3>Proper names of stars</h3>
<p>Ptolemy's star catalogue had the layout of a table listing the 
description of the star's position in the constellation's figure, 
the ecliptical coordinates, and the magnitude e.g.: "The star at the tip 
of the tail of Ursa Minor", "Gem 0 1/6, +66", "Mag 3".</p>
<p>In most cases, the star names evolved by astronomer's systematical 
abbreviations of these descriptions, e.g., a first astronomer abbreviated 
in a text "tip of the tail", a next astronomer drew a map with less space 
and wrote only "tail" next to the star and this name remained. Over 
centuries, these descriptions were translated into Arabic and Latin, and 
in some cases the translators or scribes made mistakes because of misreading 
or misspelling or the Arabic words (e.g. the Arabic "yad al gauza", the 
hand of the giant woman, was mangled to the common term "Betelgeuse").</p>
<p>However, there are also a few original Greek words like the red star 
"Antares", the counterpart of Ares (Mars), and even a few original Babylonian 
terms like "Shargaz", the Sting, in Scorpius. Our modern, most recent IAU 
star names [#7] are a renewed mixture, also with influences or even 
politically wanted additions of star names from the non-Ptolemaic sky 
cultures, e.g. the traditional Pingsing, a Chinese star name for a star 
in Hydra (its meaning is only "star", a reminescence to his lonely position), 
or newly adopted star names from Polynesian, Hawaiian, or Aboriginal 
cultures for names of stars with exoplanets.</p>
<p>The IAU is the only scientifically accepted authority to assign new 
names to stars. Commercial exploits like "star name registries", who sell 
stars for commemorative purposes or as gifts, only sell printed pieces 
of paper. These names are not approved and never used by scientists.</p>

<h3>Proper names of deep-sky objects</h3>
<p>Uranometria 2000.0 is an atlas of the 2000.0 era starry sky prepared 
by the Dutch artist Wil Thirion and published in 1987 by the American 
publishing house Willmann-Bell, specializing in astronomical literature.</p>
<p>The Atlas of Tirion, respected by astronomers for its accuracy and 
beauty, is provided with detailed tables and various indexes. The second 
volume contains three transparent overlays designed for precise measurements. 
Uranometriya 2000.0 contains more than 280,000 stars and more than 30,000 
deep-sky objects - in particular, all the objects of the Messier and 
NGC catalogs.</p>
<p>The second (corrected and most complete) three-volume edition of 
"Uranometria 2000.0", was published in 2001 under the name "Uranometria 
2000.0 Deep Sky Atlas" and contains 280035 stars of both hemispheres up 
to 9.75<sup>m</sup> in size on a scale of 1.85 cm per declination degree 
on 220 spreads of A3 format. Particular attention in the atlas is paid to 
deep-sky objects, there are more than 30 thousand of them in the second 
edition - many times more than in any other paper atlas.</p>
<p>The third volume of "Uranometria 2000.0" is a guide to deep-sky objects - 
Deep Sky Field Guide, consisting of tables with scientific data and proper 
names on objects depicted in the first two volumes [#3].</p>
