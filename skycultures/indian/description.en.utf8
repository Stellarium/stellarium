<h2>Indian Vedic</h2>
<p>Vedic sky culture with some commonly known constellations related to Nakṣatra-s.</p>

<h3>Rāśi (राशिः)</h3>
<p>The sidereal zodiac is an imaginary belt of 360 degrees (like the tropical zodiac), divided into 12 equal parts. Each twelfth part (of 30 degrees) is called a sign or rashi. Their names are shown in (brackets).</p>

<h3>Nakṣatra (नक्षत्रम्)</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In Hindu tradition the ecliptic is divided into 27 parts of approximately (but not equally) 13\tfrac{1}{3}^o, which correspond to 27 asterisms known as the nakṣatra-s  (full list, with western equivalents here: https://goo.gl/2PVi28 ). In the earliest extant layers of the tradition this number is 28. This division is critical for several purposes including timing rituals and determining the birth lunar mansions.</p>

<h4>Attestation</h4>
<p>The earliest complete nakṣatra lists are found in the Taittirīya-śruti and the Atharvaveda where they are recited as part of the nakṣatreṣṭi ritual which places the deities of pantheon in these celestial compartments. Some scholars opine that the tradition shows that by the early medieval period, the nakṣatra identification had changed to a small degree from the Vedic period.</p>
<p>In mythology the Nakshatras are considered to be the 27 daughters of Dakṣa Prajāpati and wives of Chandra, the god of moon.</p>

<h4>Notation and depiction</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the core files, we use IAST transliteration.</li>
<li>Rāśi names are placed within ().</li>
<li>Nakṣatra names are placed within [], except for abhijit, which is placed in {}.</li>
<li>Nakṣatra-s have no sky art, but 27 ecliptic longitudes need to be shown in order to effectively determine the current position of any celestial object (especially chandra or moon).</li>
