  * Drop useless Provides/Replaces/Conflicts/Breaks from libgphoto2-2-dev:
    those packages were present in 2004, so no need to still keep those
    relationships there.

libgphoto2 (2.4.10.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable
  * Removing KiBi from Uploaders, as requested. Thanks for all your
    previous work!

  * Split documentation in other two binary packages: libgphoto2-dev-doc
    and libgphoto2-doc
  * Rename libgphoto2-2-dev to libgphoto2-dev: this will ease SONAME
    transitions through binNMUs.

libgphoto2 (2.4.10.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Drop 80_kfreebsd patch, merged upstream.
  * Fix lintian warnings:
     - debian/libgphoto2-2.postrm: s{/bin/true}{true}.
     - debian/libgphoto2-2.README.Debian: fix typo.
  * Move to dh:
     - Bump debian/compat to 7.
     - Bump debhelper version in B-D to >= 7.0.50 to use overrides.
     - Use a minimal-like debian/rules and overrides to perform the
       various needed tweaks, using the quilt sequence to have patches
       applied/unapplied when appropriate.
     - Switch from dh_movefiles to dh_install.
     - Move moving docs from /u/s/d/libgphoto2{,_port} to the proper
       locations to .install files.
     - Remove all special-cases in the clean rules, the upstream one does
       its job properly.
     - Get rid of the attempt at detecting files that are installed
       nowhere, using the --list-failing dh_install option instead.
     - Following the move to dh, adapt Martin's udev patch using an
       override_dh_installudev rule, but only on Linux architectures for
       now, needed tweaks for other platforms should follow in next
       revisions.

  [ Gürkan Sengün ]
  * Add myself to uploaders.
  * Bump standards version to 3.9.1.
  * Switch to source format 3.0, drop quilt from control and rules.
  * Drop patches:
    - 10_disable_cache (does not apply anymore)
    - 45_increase_canon_timeout (upstream has increased it from 150 to 500)

  [ David Paleino ]
  * debian/rules:
    - fix typo (s,deibian,debian,)
    - simplify override_dh_auto_configure
    - simplify override_dh_gencontrol
  * Added symbols files
  * Drop 01_udev_rules_136, already in upstream sources
  * Remove type-handling dependency in debian/control, use architecture
    wildcards, as defined in Policy. Thanks to Sebastian Andrzej Siewior
    (Closes: #587873)
  * Drop duplicate Section fields in binary stanzas
  * Added ${misc:Depends} where needed
  * Use Breaks instead of versioned Conflicts
  * Added doc-base registration for API docs in libgphoto2-2-dev

libgphoto2 (2.4.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge one more patch by Martin Pitt (thanks!): move HAL FDI
    creation from debian/libgphoto2-2.postinst to debian/rules.
    This avoids problems with half-configured libraries during
    upgrade/installation (LP: #352271, Closes: #531979)
  * Remove old conffiles. We can't use dpkg-maintscript-helper,
    because they were created at install-time and thus not marked
    as conffiles. (Closes: #461397, #511129)
  * Move from /etc/udev/rules.d/ to /lib/udev/rules.d should now
    be complete (Closes: #586668)

      (Closes: #531974).
    - Create modern udev rules at build-time instead of at install-time
      thanks to a patch sent (and now merged) upstream. Drop a lot of
      code from libgphoto2-2.postinst accordingly, while adding the
      generation code to debian/rules. Also bump the versioned dependency
      on udev from 0.113-1 to 0.136 (Closes: #531978).
  * Added myself to Uploaders

libgphoto2 (2.4.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Fix FTBFS on GNU/kFreeBSD, thanks to Aurélien Jarno (Closes: #528380):
     - Only install udev-related files on Linux architectures.
     - Add a patch to fix a missing include (“struct in_addr” comes from
       <netinet/in.h> and needs to be explicitly included when on a
       non-Linux architecture): 80_kfreebsd
  * No longer call “udev reload”, rules files are said to be reloaded
    automatically (Closes: #523957):
     - debian/libgphoto2-2.post{inst,rm}

       Wolfram Quester for the report.
     - Fix support for Nikon CoolPix S60 (Closes: #520752). Thanks to
       Mathias Brodala for the report.
  * Disable patch:
     - 11_hurd_no_path_max_bsdsource: Disable for now, no longer applies.
  * Drop patch:
     - 60_udev_rules_are_autogenerated_notice: Merged upstream.
  * debian/rules:
     - Do not bump shlibs (no new symbols).
  * debian/control:
     - Bump Standards-Version from 3.8.0 to 3.8.1 (no changes needed).

libgphoto2 (2.4.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/copyright:
     - Update accordingly.
  * debian/rules:
     - Bump SHLIBS accordingly (new symbols), from 2.4.0 to 2.4.3.
  * Switch from dpatch to quilt (run away!):
     - debian/control: Update Build-Depends.
     - debian/patches: Strip “.dpatch” suffix, rename 00list to series.
     - debian/rules: Update “include”, update dependency on patch stamp.
  * Drop previously-backported patches:
     - debian/patches/20_backport_initial_startup_speedup
     - debian/patches/30_backport_dropping_panasonic_ids
  * Disable the following patch. It was used to increase the
    CANON_FAST_TIMEOUT parameter which appeared to be too low. Since
    upstream increased it, let's no longer diverge from them. For the
    records, the original bugreport was #453114, but please open a new
    bugreport if the bug is back:
     - debian/patches/45_increase_canon_timeout

libgphoto2 (2.4.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backport patch from upstream to disable some buggy Panasonic IDs
    (04da:2372) to ensure those cameras can be used as mass-storage
    devices (Closes: #479135, #482848):
     - Add 30_backport_dropping_panasonic_ids.dpatch

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Sat, 16 Aug 2008 13:20:13 +0200

libgphoto2 (2.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Since 2.4.2 was released a bit before the freeze, not rushing its
    upload for lenny. After having asked usptream, the r11066 revision
    deserves to be backported, so as to improve the initial startup
    time. Thanks to Marcus Meissner for having provided the tip, along
    with the patch:
     - Add 20_backport_initial_startup_speedup.dpatch
  * Version the Recommends on udev (which is conditionally specified
    through the ${udev-hotplug} variable in debian/rules), since
    libgphoto2 now uses the alternative syntax (that is: key!="a|b"),
    which apparently was introduced in udev 0.109. Adding “(>= 0.113-1)”
    since that's the first version in Debian which included this
    feature. Many thanks to Jan Echternach for having spotted the problem
    as well as its solution (Closes: #491065).

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Jul 2008 23:49:37 +0200

libgphoto2 (2.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #480127):
     - Not bumping shlibs, no new symbol.
     - To achieve this, use two dh_makeshlibs calls (one for
       libgphoto2-port0 and one for libgphoto2-$(major), and provide with
       the last upstream version sharing the same ABI. Using 2.4.0 here
       although some former versions might have been specified. That
       shouldn't make any difference from a testing migration point of
       view.
  * debian/copyright:
     - Use an almost decent copyright format, as discussed on
       <http://wiki.debian.org/Proposals/CopyrightFormat>.
     - Properly specify copyright holders and licenses, grouping them by
       components when possible.
  * debian/patches:
     - Drop 30_additional_camera_support.dpatch, merged upstream.
     - Update 45_increase_canon_timeout.dpatch, upstream bumped the
       timeout from 75 to 150 (Debian had 750), but 750 looks doing a
       better job according to user comments on the tracker. Keeping that
       value.
     - Drop 65_udev_usb_subsystem.dpatch, merged upstream (using another
       approach).
     - Drop 75_deprecated_hal_key.dpatch, merged upstream.
     - Drop disabled patches (from the list and from that directory) since
       one can get them back from the VCS.
  * debian/libgphoto2-2.dirs:
     - Drop “/usr/share/hal/fdi/information/10freedesktop” from
       there. There's no use shipping an empty directory (especially since
       the maintainer scripts are taking care of removing files previously
       created in that directory).
  * debian/libgphoto2-2-dev.files:
     - Drop “*.la” files from /usr/lib only (not from the subdirectories).
     - Remove them in debian/rules before trying to remove debian/tmp.
     - Drop the recursive symlink (“/usr/include/gphoto2/gphoto2 -> .”).
     - Remove it in debian/rules before running dh_movefiles.
  * debian/rules:
     - Remove “patch” and “unpatch” targets since dpatch.make is included
       already.
     - Move the single dependency on “unpatch-stamp” to “unpatch” since
       there's no stamp for “unpatch”.
     - Move the dependency on “patch” to “patch-stamp”, so as to avoid
       unneeded ./configure re-runs.
  * debian/control:
     - Clean the Depends of the -dev package:
        - Use libc-dev instead of libc6-dev (there are at least libc0.1,
          libc0.3, libc6, libc6.1 and their -dev packages).
        - Remove libltdl3-dev, no longer needed since “*.la” files are no
          longer shipped under /usr/lib.
     - Remove a trailing space in all long descriptions.
     - Bump Standards-Version from 3.7.3 to 3.8.0 (no change needed).
     - Add back graphviz to generate all documentation items.
     - Update my mail address.

libgphoto2 (2.4.0-9) unstable; urgency=high

  * Adopt the package within pkg-phototools:
     - Set the Maintainer to the group.
     - Add Frederic Peters and myself as Uploaders.
     - Add Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Git fields accordingly.
  * debian/control:
     - Add a Depends: on libltdl3-dev to libgphoto2-2-dev since libltdl.la
       is referenced in a bunch of “.la” files (Closes: #467527). Setting
       urgency to “high” accordingly, since the bug is also in testing.
     - Add a Homepage field.
     - Make lintian happy, delete the “-1” bits from the versioned B-D on
       libhal-dev.
     - Bump Standards-Version from 3.7.2 to 3.7.3 (no changes needed).
  * debian/copyright:
     - Point to LGPL-2 rather than just LGPL, which now points to
       LGPL-3 (the copyright says LGPL-2+, but let's be precise).
  * debian/patches:
     - Add 75_deprecated_hal_key.dpatch: Replace the deprecated HAL
       property “info.bus” with “info.subsystem” in the HAL FDI generation
       tool, thanks to Martin Pitt (Closes: #472656).
