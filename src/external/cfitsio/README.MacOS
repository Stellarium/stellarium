By default, the CFITSIO library will be a "Universal Binary" (i.e.
32- and 64-bit compatible) under Mac OS X when built in the standard
way, i.e.

- tar xzf cfitsio3370.tar.gz (or whatever version this is)
- cd cfitsio/

- ./configure
- make
- make install

---------------------------------------------------------------------
To install CFITSIO using MacPorts:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have MacPorts installed, you may install CFITSIO simply with
the command

  $ sudo port install cfitsio +universal

For more information, please visit:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
To install CFITSIO using Homebrew:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have Homebrew installed, you may install CFITSIO simply with
the command

  $ brew install cfitsio

For more information, please visit:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
To build CFITSIO using the XCode GUI:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- tar xzf cfitsio3370.tar.gz (or whatever version this is)
- cd cfitsio/

- Start Xcode and open cfitsio.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj,
  or just "open" the file from a terminal command line,

   $ open cfitsio.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj

  and this will start up XCode for you.

- Press the Build (or "Play") button in the upper left
  corner of the GUI.

Below, are the old (and now obsolete) instructions for building CFITSIO
on classic Mac OS-9 or earlier versions:

1. Un binhex and unstuff cfitsio_mac.sit.hqx
2. put CFitsioPPC.mcp in the cfitsio directory.
2. Load CFitsioPPC.mcp into CodeWarrior Pro 5 and make.
   This builds the cfitsio library for PPC.  There are also targets for both 
   the test program and the speed test program.

To use the MacOS port you can add Cfitsio PPC.lib to your Codewarrior Pro 5
project.  Note that this only has been tested for the PPC. It probably
won't work on 68k macs.  Also note that the fortran bindings aren't
included.  I haven't worked with the codewarrior f2c plugin so I don't know
how these would work.  If one is interested, please write and I can look
into this.
