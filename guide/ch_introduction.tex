\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:Introduction}

\emph{Stellarium} is a software project that allows people to use their
home computer as a virtual planetarium. It calculates the positions of
the Sun and Moon, planets and stars, and draws how the sky would look to
an observer depending on their location and the time. It can also draw
the constellations and simulate astronomical phenomena such as meteor
showers or comets, and solar or lunar eclipses.

Stellarium may be used as an educational tool for teaching about the
night sky, as an observational aid for amateur astronomers wishing to
plan a night's observing or even drive their telescopes to observing
targets, or simply as a curiosity (it's fun!). Because of the high
quality of the graphics that Stellarium produces, it is used in some
real planetarium projector products and museum projection setups. Some
amateur astronomy groups use it to create sky maps for describing
regions of the sky in articles for newsletters and magazines, and the
exchangeable sky cultures feature invites its use in the field of
Cultural Astronomy research and outreach.

Stellarium is still under development, and by the time you read
this guide, a newer version may have been released with even more
features than those documented here. Check for updates to Stellarium at
the Stellarium website\footnote{\url{https://stellarium.org}}.

Stellarium itself, visit the Stellarium site at

\section{Historical notes}
\label{sec:Introduction:HistoricalNotes}

Fabien Ch\'ereau started the project during the summer 2000, and throughout
the years found continuous support by a small team of enthusiastic developers.

Here is a list of past and present major contributors sorted roughly by date of
arrival on the project:
\newpage

  passed away in October 2014 at age 80. He was a major contributor on
  the forums, wiki pages and mailing list where his good will and
  enthusiasm is strongly missed. \ifthenelse{\equal{\StelVersion}{0.15.0}}{Version 0.15 of Stellarium is
  dedicated in his memory.}{} RIP Barry.

\item[Marcos Cardinot] MeteorShowers plugin
\item[Florian Schaukowitsch] Scenery 3D plugin, Remote Control plugin, RemoteSync plugin, OBJ rendering, Qt/OpenGL internals
\item[Teresa Huertas Rold√°n] Planetary nomenclature 
\end{description}

Unfortunately time is evolving, and most members of the original
development team are no longer able to devote most of their spare time
to the project (some are still available for limited work
which requires specific knowledge about the project).

As of 2017, the project's maintainer is Alexander Wolf, doing most
maintenance and regular releases. He has also introduced the AstroCalc module.
Other new features are contributed
mostly by Georg Zotti and his team focusing on extensions of
Stellarium's applicability in the fields of historical and cultural
astronomy research (which means Stellarium is getting more accurate)
and outreach (making it usable for museum installations), but also on
graphic items like comet tails or the Zodiacal Light.

\section{Acknowledgements}
Stellarium has been kindly supported by ESA in their Summer of Code in
Space initiatives, which so far has resulted in better planetary rendering
(2012), the Meteor Showers plugin (2013), the web-based remote
control and an alternative solution for planetary positions based on
the DE430/DE431 ephemeris (2015), the RemoteSync plugin and OBJ models (2016), 
and the planet nomenclature labels (2017). Some of Georg's work is
in part supported by the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological
Prospection and Virtual Archaeology, Vienna, Austria.

\section{Scientific use}

Stellarium has gained wide popularity in the research areas of
cultural astronomy. Please note limitations of Stellarium mentioned in
Appendix~\ref{ch:Accuracy}. If you used Stellarium in scientific work,
please cite our recent paper \citep{Zotti-etal:JSA2020.6.2}.

\section{About this User Guide}
This guide is based on the user guide written by Matthew Gates for
version 0.10 around 2008. The guide was then ported to the Stellarium
wiki and continuously updated by Barry Gerdes and Alexander Wolf up to version 0.12. 
Unfortunately, some new features were not properly documented in the wiki, and generally, 
without Barry the wiki started to fall out of sync with
the actual program.  In late 2015 we (Alexander and Georg) started porting the texts
back to \LaTeX{} and updated and added information where necessary, 
or wrote new chapters for the features which were introduced in the last years. 
We feel that a single book is the better format for offline
reading. The PDF version of this guide has a clickable table of
contents and clickable hyperlinks.

These new editions of the Guide (since V0.15) will not contain notes about using
earlier versions than 0.13 or using very outdated hardware. 
New features are marked with a version number like 0.15.2 in the margin. 
Some references to previous versions may still be made for completeness, 
but if you are using earlier versions of Stellarium 
for particular reasons, please use the older guides.
