# Chinese Song Dynasty Sky

## Introduction

This sky culture is based on the observation data from the 4th year of the Huangyou era (1052 AD), and aims to faithfully reconstruct the star map of China during the Song Dynasty. This sky culture comprises 283 Xingguans (星官, Chinese Constellations) and 1464 stars (including clusters M7, M44) from the *Xinyixiangfayao Star Map*. 

## Description

###  Xingguan System

The Chinese system of Xingguans originated in antiquity. During the Warring States period (475–221 BC), astronomers Gan De (甘德) and Shi Shen (石申) established independent systems. Another system was attributed to the legendary figure Wuxian (巫咸) of the Shang Dynasty  (16th century BC–1046 BC), though modern scholarship suggests it was likely compiled by later generations in his name. In the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD), astronomer Chen Zhuo (陈卓) synthesized these three systems into a unified one, defining 283 Xingguans and 1464 stars. This framework became the standard and was later immortalized in the *Song of the Sky Pacers (步天歌)*, a Tang Dynasty astronomical text written in verse. It remained largely stable until the introduction of Western astronomy in the 17th century.

An important concept within this system is the *determinative star*. Before the 17th century, Chinese astronomers generally did not assign names to individual stars; instead, they designated a primary star—though not necessarily the brightest—within each Xingguan as its determinative star. Astronomical observations primarily documented the coordinates of these determinative stars, though in particularly important or special Xingguans, additional stars could also be selected for observation and recording, or even assigned names. For each Xingguan from which a determinative star can be identified, we have marked its determinative star.

**The determinative stars of the Twenty-eight Lunar Mansions were of particular importance, forming—together with the North Celestial Pole—the fundamental reference framework for the ancient Chinese equatorial coordinate system.** 

Due to precession, the determinative stars of the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions have varied across different historical periods. A notable example involves the mansions of Turtle Beak and Three Stars. During the Song Dynasty and earlier periods, the determinative star for Turtle Beak was φ¹ Ori, while for Three Stars it was δ Ori. By the 13th century, however, precession had caused φ¹ Ori to shift to a position east of δ Ori, resulting in the phenomenon known as "Turtle Beak lying within Three Stars," which contradicted the traditional sequence of the Twenty-Eight Mansions. This discrepancy became increasingly pronounced by the Qing Dynasty, leading the Imperial Observatory to redefine the determinative stars: for Three Stars, it was changed from δ Ori to ζ Ori, and for Turtle Beak, from φ¹ Ori to λ Ori.

### Restore Sky Map

The Imperial Observatory of the Song Dynasty conducted several large-scale stellar observations with remarkable accuracy, surpassing all previous eras in precision. The data from the 4th year of the Huangyou era (1052 AD) is the most complete set that survives today. Based on these records, two significant star charts were produced: the *Xinyixiangfayao Star Map* (based on observational data from 1052 AD, created in 1088 AD) and the *Suzhou Star Map* (based on observational data from 1078 to 1085 AD, carved in 1247 AD).

The historian of astronomy Pan Nai (潘鼐) systematically compiled the observational data from the Huangyou era into the *Huangyou Star Catalog*. By cross-referencing it with the *Xinyixiangfayao Star Map* in his work *The History of Stellar Observation in China*, he reconstructed most of the Song Dynasty Xingguans, serving as the primary reference for this project.

In their work *Roving China Heavens*, Qi Rui (齐锐) and Wan Haoyi (万昊宜) also reconstructed the Song Dynasty Xingguans. Their research primarily referenced the *Suzhou Star Map* . Since the observational data used for this star map dates from slightly later than 1052 AD, *Roving China Heavens* serves as supplementary reference material for this study.

Due to the limitations of observational technology and potential errors in transmission, different scholarly reconstructions may vary slightly. Based on the aforementioned works, Stellarium faithfully reconstructs the Chinese night sky of 1052 AD.

### Sun, Moon and Planets

Great Yang (太阳, Tàiyáng): The Sun. In Chinese philosophy, it represents the pinnacle of Yang energy.

Great Yin (太阴, Tàiyīn): The Moon. It represents the pinnacle of Yin energy.

Division Star (辰星, Chénxīng): Mercury. Since Mercury always moves within 30 degrees on either side of the Sun, the angular unit *Chen* was defined accordingly, representing 30 degrees. The celestial circle is divided into twelve *Chen*. Hence, Mercury came to be called the *Division Star*.

Grand White (太白, Tàibái): Venus. It is named for its extremely high brightness and pure white color.

Spark-Weaver (荧惑, Yínghuò): Mars. It is named for its fiery red color and its erratic, unpredictable orbit.

Year Star (岁星, Suìxīng): Jupiter. Jupiter's orbital period of approximately 12 years was used by the ancients to mark the cycle of years, hence its name.

Stabilizer Star (填星, Zhènxīng): Saturn. In traditional theory, Saturn was believed to take about 28 years to orbit the heavens, *guarding* or *filling* one lunar mansion each year.
