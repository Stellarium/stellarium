In order to build the INDI gphoto drivers, you must have:
cmake installed
libgphoto installed
INDI installed along with the header files.
cfitsio installed
libpthread installed
dcraw installed

Run:
cmake .
make
sudo make install

The standalone app can be buit via:
gcc -DGPHOTO_TEST -Wall -o gphoto_driver gphoto_driver.c -lgphoto2 -lpthread

This only requires libagphoto2 and not INDI
