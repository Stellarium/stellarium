;; configure nothing (comment away the line) to walk on the visible scenery (including trees, spikes, walls etc., usually not what you want)
;; or hava a separate export for a ground layer to walk, usually this is what you need: Houses without rooves, plazas without pillars, etc.

description=Testscene for Stellarium/scenery3d development. Export from SU8-Kerkythea-KT2OBJ. <br><br>The pillars, as seen from center, provide an approximate view (not hi-precision!) to solstice/equinox sunrise/sunset positions. The central pillars provide an east-west-line. A rotation of 4.2 deg (test for meridian convergence) must be compensated! Walkaround ground coordinates (Ctrl-R, T) should display the coordinates visible along the south and west border of the ground. This model is also used for testing the plugin's graphical capabilities, so material parameters may look odd sometimes. 

;; location removed, so you can load the testscene without leaving your place. Usually, a scenery really should have accurate location coordinates!

;; meridian convergence angle means an angular offset of the "grid north" from astronomical north. 
;; For locations West of the zone meridian and on the Northern hemisphere, convergence is negative.
;; This means, the model has to be rotated counterclockwise around the vertical axis to align grid-oriented model to true north.
