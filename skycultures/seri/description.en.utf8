<h1>Seri (Comca'ac)</h1> 

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seri_people">Seri people</a> are an indigenous group in Mexico.</p>

<p>There have been six different Comca'ac groups (Comca'ac means "people"): 
<!-- GZ: If this list describes the past, the "inhabit" etc. should be put to past tense, like "inhabited" -->
<ul> 
<!-- GZ: I cannot find San Esteban in Google Earth. Maybe same as Isla Angel de la Guarda? Or Isla Turón? -->
 <li> the Xica hacataj quitoj, who eat meat of sharks, inhabit San Esteban Island;</li>
 <li>the Xnamotat, who live in the south, inhabit San Carlos, Guaymas and Tastiota; </li>
 <li>the Cail hitic 'tamoc, the men from the valley, inhabit the region between Tastiota and Bahía Kino;</li>
 <!-- GZ: Google Earth names the island Tiburón. Which spelling should be preferred? --> 
 <li>the Heno comca'ac, who live in the mountains, inhabit the centre of Tiburán Island; </li>
 <li>the Tepocaj, the fishermen, who inhabit the region between Puerto Libertad y Puerto Peñasco; and, </li>
 <!-- GZ: These also live on San Esteban like the first group? -->
 <li>the Tosni hox hanoquipilc, who feed themselves on sea birds (ducks and pelicans), inhabit Island San Esteban.</li>
</ul></p>
<p> Nowadays, the Seri people live at Punta Chueca and Desemboque, located in the coast of the northwestern state of Sonora, M&#233;xico.  
According with the fishing cycles, Comca'ac occupy several fishing camps at the litoral distributed along a 100 km territory. 

<!-- GZ: AGAIN: Google Earth names the island Tiburón. Which of the 3 spellings should be preferred? --> 
The whole area assigned to them reaches the 210 thousand hectares which corresponds to a region in the continent and the Tibur&#235;on Island in the California gulf.</p>

<p> The Seri language (coiiqui'itom) forms part of the seriyumana family which means that, on one hand, 
its most recent relation can be given by the yumano coming from the north of the Californian peninsula, 
and, on the other hand, this language totally contrasts with the languages of its neibourging nations 
<!-- GZ: The word "filum" in the next line is not English, and I fail to guess it. Please correct. -->
who talk uto-aztec ones like pima, p&#225;pago, yaqui and mayo; all of them filum with a much more recent origin.</p>

<p><img src="abuela.png" width="250" align="left" />The description of the Comca'ac 
(Seri) Constellations presented here comes from the book "Bajo el cielo Comca'ac: Astronomía entre 
el mar y el desierto", written by Arturo Morales Blanco, in which it is possible to identify the relations 
between sky, sea and desert, as they are recovered by oral tradition and family memories.</p>

<p>This knowledge has arrived to us by oral transmission from generation to generation through time and 
shows how the events from the sea like the appearance of crabs or the abundance of Totoaba (a large fish, now in danger), 
comes along with the presence of sets of stars in the sky. Comca'ac people has named them Zaamth or Zix cam 
caoc'la, respectively; also, the coincidence of Pitahayas (cactus fruits) in the cactus with the appearance of constellation 
Hácosa (Corta-pitahayas) in the sky is very suggestive.</p>

<td><p>When the stars of Orion's Belt, Rigel and Betelgeuse appear above the western horizon, in the month 
of March, Comca'ac people see how in shallow waters of the marsh, the crabs are found forming groups of 
about 300 or 400 items which can be collected easily; that is the reason to call Zaamth to constellation. 
After six months, when the sea is cold, the crabs do not appear any more going from one place to another; 
instead the sea wheat, xnois, comes and their seed has been used to make flour and different food plates for 
centuries. The legend says that in the days corresponding to the crab "harvesting", it must be avoided to break

times, as Cohamc constellation, women. Then four or five days after the rains begin to fall with intensity 
and the wind runs by the desert. The star that is at the north of the alignment, the Comca'ac's name is 
Hacamta, the husband, and is the one appearing behind the other six named women, (the star Psi of Ursa 
Major); the six stars appear in sequence, two by two. The forecast of this bad weather motivated their 
ancestors to go to the caves in the mountain and to go far from the beach. After the difficult days, 
around two months later, Comca'ac people returned to the beach carrying with them all the food and

<td><p>This constellation is, perhaps, the most complex of Comca'ac ones, due to the fact that it 
covers a wide area in the sky and in it, one can find stars from Taurus, Twins, and the Capella star. 
It can be said that Hapjc (Deer hunter) has: the deer (white tail, bura and bighorn, or Hépem, 
Háap and Mójit, respectively) which are the stars known as Hassaleh, Elnath and 123 Tau; the 
arrow with its flint at Aldebaran and the stars forming a 'V' of Taurus, while the feathers are 
Castor and Pollux of Gemini. The hunter is Cozaactim ("Who crosses"), properly said, his head is 
Capella.</p>
<!-- GZ: This is ambiguous. You usually don't throw arrows. Either "shot his arrow" or "threw his spear". -->
<p>The legend says that Cozaactim threw his arrow and hit the Bura deer. Háap was wounded and flew 
through the sky bleeding; then, a little drop of blood fell in the Tiburón Island, and that is the reason 
<!-- GZ: Probably better to say "September morning skies"? -->
why bura deer are native of the island. This constellation can be observed in September sky.</p></td>

ancestors used as bait. This constellation goes, month after month, revolving in the sky and it is seen

harpoons to capture their preys and a "flint" harpoon or double point tool. The legend says that many 
years ago, with the appearance of this star in the sky, the floriation of cactus begun and at the end 
of the week, there were Pitahayas on them; however, the next day, all the pitahayas disappeared: it was

he was still absent, and the members of his camp considered him dead. But several months later, at daybreak, 
he has shown himself to his parents who were surprised telling him: "We thought you were dead, we have spent many days 
looking for you, until we were tired; we cried for you a lot". The young man told his parents: "I live 
near the beach, I found a good place and stayed there". "But what kind of water you drink?" They asked. 
"I found any water and that is I drink, Haxhaxaha tahomisi", he said to them while talking about the Tecomate 
Bay.</p>
<p>According to this legend, the young hunter became the Constellation with Canopus at its centre caused 
by a conflict with his elder brother. It appears directly towards the south.</p></td>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All this knowledge of Comca'ac people comes from prehispanic epoch, and it has prevailed through 
centuries, thanks to oral tradition and the strength of the community to colonization, at first, and his 
opposition to evangelization, later on. Still today, it is possible to hear the stories and legends 
behind the naming of constellations and the events on the sea and on the desert. With the recovery of 
these legends, by exercise of memory and lively events with his ancestors, Arturo Morales Blanco gave us 
a legacy that must be conserved for future generations: children, young people who will keep in their 
own language how and what to look for in the sky.</p>
