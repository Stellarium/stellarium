<h2>Mars (Utopia Planitia)</h2>
<p> The <a href="http://www.cnsa.gov.cn/n6758823/n6758838/c6812123/content.html">panoramic view</a> of the landing site (Utopia Planitia of Mars) is a 360 degrees ring shot taken by the navigation terrain camera on the mast of Zhurong, the Chinese Mars rover of Tianwen-1, after correction and mosaic stitching. The image shows that the terrain near the landing site is flat, the Martian horizon can be seen in the distance, and the abundance and size of the rocks are consistent with expectations, indicating that the autonomous selection of the landing site and the implementation of hovering obstacle avoidance are effective. The Mars topography map is the first topography and geomorphology image map taken by the navigation terrain camera after the rover reaches the surface of Mars.</p>
