/** \file indidevapi.h
    \brief Interface to the reference INDI C API device implementation on the Device Driver side.
*
\author Elwood C. Downey
\author Jasem Mutlaq

This file is divided into two main sections:\n
<ol><li> Functions the INDI device driver framework defines which the Driver may
call:</li>

<ul><li>IDxxx functions to send messages to an INDI client.</li>
<li>IExxx functions to implement the event driven model.</li>
<li>IUxxx functions to perform handy utility functions.</li></ul>

<li>Functions the INDI device driver framework calls which the Driver must
define:</li>

<ul><li>ISxxx to respond to messages from a Client.</li></ul></ol>

<p>These functions are the interface to the INDI C-language Device Driver
reference implementation library. Any driver that uses this interface is
expected to \#include "indidevapi.h" and to link with indidrivermain.o and
eventloop.o. Indidevapi.h further includes indiapi.h. The former contains
the prototypes for the functions documented here, although many functions
take arguments defined in the latter.</p>

<p>These functions make it much easier to write a compliant INDI driver than
starting from scratch, and also serve as a concrete
example of the interactions an INDI driver, in any language, is expected to
accommodate.</p>

<p>The reference driver framework and the optimizations made within the reference
indiserver both assume and require that one driver program implements exactly
one logical INDI device.</p>

<p>The functions in this framework fall into two broad categories. Some are
functions that a driver must define because they are called by the reference
framework; these functions begin with IS. The remaining functions are library
utilities a driver may use to do important operations.</p>

<p>A major point to realize is that an INDI driver built with this framework
does not contain the C main() function. As soon as a driver begins executing,
it listens on stdin for INDI messages. Only when a valid and appropriate
message is received will it then call the driver via one of the IS functions.
The driver is then expected to respond promptly by calling one of the ID
library functions. It may also use any of the IU utility functions as desired
to make processing a message easier.</p>

<p>Rather separate from these IS, ID and IU functions are a collection of
functions that utilize the notion of a callback. In a callback design,
the driver registers a function with the framework to be called under
certain circumstances. When said circumstances occur, the framework will
call the callback function. The driver never calls these callbacks directly.
These callback functions begin with IE. They can arrange for a callback
function to be called under three kinds of circumstances: when a given file
descriptor may be read without blocking (because either data is available
or EOF has been encountered), when a given time interval has elapsed, or
when the framework has nothing urgent to do. The callback functions for each
circumstance must be written according to a well defined prototype since,
after all, the framework must know how to call the callback correctlty.</p>

<p>Each of the following functions creates the appropriate XML formatted
INDI message from its arguments and writes it to stdout. From there, is it
typically read by indiserver which then sends it to the clients that have
expressed interest in messages from the Device indicated in the message.</p>

<p>In addition to type-specific arguments, all end with a printf-style format
string, and appropriate subsequent arguments, that form the \param msg
attribute within the INDI message. If the format argument is NULL, no message
attribute is included with the message. Note that a \e timestamp
attribute is also always added automatically based on the clock on the
computer on which this driver is running.</p>
