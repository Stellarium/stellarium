TW    Mon    Wachmann [03453] assigns the variable to the RRab
TW    Mon    type with the elements Max = 2433001.371 + 0.8743887*E,
TW    Mon    but notes a considerable dispersion of the points around
TW    Mon    the mean light curve obtained with this period. As the
TW    Mon    periods by Hessner (PH) and Wachmann (PW) are mutually
TW    Mon    related (1/PW ~1/PH + 1) it is more probable on account of
TW    Mon    the above mentioned circumstance that the variable belongs
