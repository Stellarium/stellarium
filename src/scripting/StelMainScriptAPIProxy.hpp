#include <QObject>

//! @class StelMainScriptAPIProxy
//! Because the core API runs in a different thread to the main program, 
//! direct function calls to some classes can cause problems - especially 
//! when images must be loaded, or other non-atomic operations are involved.
//!
//! This class acts as a proxy - running in the Main thread.  Connect signals
//! from the StelMainScriptAPI to the instance of this class running in the
//! main thread and let the slots do the work which is not possible within
//! StelMainScriptAPI itself.
//! 
//! Please follow the following convention:
//! member in StelMainScriptAPI:      someSlot(...)
//! signal in StelMainScriptAPI:      requestSomeSlot(...)
//! member in StelMainScriptAPIProxy: someSlot(...)
//!
//! The dis-advantage of this method is that there is no way to get a return
//! value.  This is because of how the signal/slot mechanism works.
