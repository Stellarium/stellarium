\chapter{Accuracy}
\label{ch:Accuracy}

Stellarium originally was developed to present a beautiful simulation
of the night sky, mostly to understand what is visible in the sky when
you leave your house, i.e., for present times. To save computation
time, some concessions were made in astronomical accuracy by using
simplified models which seemed acceptable at that time. However, many
users started to overstress Stellarium's capabilities to simulate the
historical sky of many centuries in the past, and found
inconsistencies.  Unfortunately, celestial motions are indeed more
complicated than a simple clockwork, and the process of retrofitting
detailed and accurate models which started around v0.11.0 is not
completed yet. Therefore, when using Stellarium for scientific work
like eclipse simulation to illustrate records found in Cuneiform
tablets, always also use some other reference to compare, and of 
course specify the program version you used for your work. (The next version 
may be more accurate or at least provide different results!) You can of
course contact us if you are willing and able to help improving
Stellarium's accuracy!

\section{Date Range}
\label{sec:Accuracy:DateRange}

The calendar dates are limited to a very wide interval of years -100.000\ldots100.000. 
This is mostly useful to visualize the effect of stellar proper motions. 
If you observe the planets or especially the moon, you will find that it seems to run 
on a polar orbit around +78.000 and even retrograde on a highly elongated orbit a few millennia after that. 
This is obvious nonsense, caused by extrapolating mathematical models in inappropriate ways. 

\section{Stellar Proper Motion}
\label{sec:Accuracy:ProperMotion}

Even though you can follow stellar proper motion for tens of thousands of years, 
please note that the computation only takes the linear components $\Delta\alpha$, $\Delta\delta$ into account. 
For times far from today, a true 3D computation would be required, 
so that also changes in distance (and thus, brighness) could be simulated. 
Still, the simulation here should give a good impression which close and/or fast stars 
will move over time, and thus how constellations become deformed.


\section{Planetary Positions}
\label{sec:Accuracy:Planets}

Stellarium uses the VSOP87 theory~\cite{1988A&A...202..309B}\footnote{\url{http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/ftp-index?/ftp/cats/VI/81}}
to calculate the positions of the planets over time.

%As with other methods, the accuracy of the calculations vary according
%to the planet and the time for which one makes the calculation. Reasons
%for these inaccuracies include the fact that the motion of the planet
%isn't as predictable as Newtonian mechanics would have us believe.
VSOP87 is an analytical ephemeris modeled to match the numerical
integration run DE200 from NASA JPL, which by itself gives positions for 1850\ldots2050. 
Its use is recommended for the years -4000\ldots+8000. You can observe the sun leaving the ``ecliptic
of date'' and running on the ``ecliptic J2000'' outside this date
range. This is obviously a mathematical trick to keep
continuity. Still, positions may be somewhat useful outside this
range, but don't expect anything reliable 50,000 years in the past! 

The optionally usable JPL DE431 delivers planet positions strictly for
-13000\ldots+17000 only, and nothing outside, but likely with higher accuracy. 
Outside of this range, positions from VSOP87 will be shown again.

As far as Stellarium is concerned, the user should bear in mind the
following limits of the VSOP87 method. Accuracy values for VSOP87 are
heliocentric as given in \cite{1988A&A...202..309B}.

\section{Minor Bodies}
\label{sec:Accuracy:MinorBodies}

Positions for the Minor Bodies (Dwarf Planets, Asteroids, Comets) are
computed with standard algorithms found in astronomical text
books. The generally used method of orbital elements allows to compute
the positions of the respective object on an undisturbed Kepler orbit
around the sun. However, gravitational, and in the case of comets,
non-gravitational (outgassing) disturbances slowly change these
orbital elements. Therefore an \emph{epoch} is given for such
elements, and computation of positions for times far from this epoch
will lead to positional errors. Therefore, when searching for
asteroids or comets, always update your orbital elements, and use
elements with an epoch as close to your time of observation as
possible! Stellarium does not simulate gravitational perturbances and
orbital changes of minor bodies passing major planets.

\section{Precession and Nutation}
\label{sec:Accuracy:Precession}

Since v0.14.0, Stellarium computes the orientation of earth's axis
according to the IAU2006 Precession in a long-time variant developed
by Vondr\'ak et al.~\cite{2011AA:Vondrak} and IAU2000B Nutation~\cite{Nutation:IAU2000B}. 
This also now allows proper depiction of the changes in ecliptic obliquity
and display of ``instantaneous precession circles'' around the
ecliptic poles. These circles are indeed varying according to
ecliptical obliquity. Nutation is only computed for about 500 years
around J2000.0. Nobody could have observed it before 1609, and it is
unclear for how long this model is applicable.

\section{Planet Axes}
\label{sec:Accuracy:PlanetAxes}

Orientation for the other planets is still simplified. Future versions
should implement modern IAU guidelines.

\section{Eclipses}
\label{sec:Accuracy:Eclipses}

The moon's motion is very complicated, and eclipse computations can be tricky. 
One aspect which every student of history, prehistory and archaeology should 
know but as it seems not every does, is at least a basic understanding of the 
irregular slow-down of earth's rotation known as $\Delta T$. 

Eclipse records on cuneiform tablets go back to the 8th century BC, some Chinese 
records go back a bit further. Experts on Earth rotation have provided models 
for $\Delta T$ based on such observations. These are usually given as parabolic fit, 
with some recommended time span. Extrapolating erratic curves too far into the past is dangerous, 
pointless and inevitably leads to errors or invalid results. Models differ by many hours 
when applied to far in the past. This is not a problem of Stellarium, 
but of current knowledge. You may find a solar eclipse in the 6th millennium BC, 
but you cannot even be sure which side of Earth could observe it!

WANTED: A model for $\Delta T$ that works in the Mesolithic! 

\section{The Calendar}
\label{sec:Accuracy:Calendar}

Stellarium follows the widely accepted convention that dates before the Gregorian calendar 
reform are given in the Julian calendar, introduced by \name{Julius Caesar}\index{Julius Caesar} in 46~BC. 
If you want to show summer solstice in the year -2500, you will notice it is not on June 21st. 
This is not an error of Stellarium -- the Gregorian reform had a reason! In prehistoric times, 
it may be more useful to work with solar ecliptic longitudes. Summer solstice is at $\lambda=90$.

\name{Julius Caesar}\index{Julius Caesar} was assassinated in March 44~BC=-43 (see below). His simple 4-year leap rule was 
then misapplied by the high priests of Rome. \name{Augustus}\index{Augustus} fixed the calendar, and only 8~AD was the 
first correctly applied leap year as we know them. Be careful if you are working in Augustean times: 
Stellarium does not model these issues!

Some authors (esp.\ for Mesoamerican dates) give dates in the proleptic Gregorian calendar 
(apply the Gregorian leap year rules before 1582). This is a convention, they may do that, 
but you must do the conversion to the Julian calendar to visualize the sky with Stellarium. 
Hopefully they also give Julian Day numbers (JD), you can use them with Stellarium. 
JD numbers are independent from calendar systems. 

Some have noted a difference of one between dates given as BC versus Stellarium's negative years. 
Note that historical chronology does not know a year Zero! (Try to write this date in Roman numbers!) 
Year 1~AD was preceded by year 1~BC. Astronomers want to simplify computations and therefore 
use a year 0 (equivalent to 1~BC). It is simple: 1~BC=0, 2~BC=-1, \ldots. 100~BC=-99. 
Stellarium is an astronomy program. Just accept this.
