I (Johannes Gajdosik) have just taken the data obtained from above
(VSOP87.mer,...,VSOP87.nep) and rearranged it into this piece of software.

I can neither allow nor forbid the usage of VSOP87.
The copyright notice below covers not the work of Bretagnon P. and Francou G.
but just my work, that is the compilation of the VSOP87 data
into the software supplied in this file.

This is my implementation of the VSOP87 planetary solution.
I tried to optimize for speed by rearranging the terms so that
for a given touple of (a[0],a[1],...,a[11]) the values
  (cos,sin)(a[0]*lambda[0](T)+...a[11]*lambda[11](T))
have only to be calculated once.
Furthermore I used the addition formulas
  (cos,sin)(x+y) = ...
so that for given T the functions cos and sin have only to be called 12 times.


ATTENTION! Due to static caching the parallelization to run in several threads works only as long as 'body' (the planet number) is different.
