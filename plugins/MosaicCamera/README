Mosaic Camera Overlay Stellarium plugin
=======================================

Overlays mosaic camera sensor outlines on the Stellarium celestial sphere.

Available Cameras
=================

Built-in cameras include:
  LSSTCam : https://www.lsst.org/about/camera
  HSC : https://www.naoj.org/Projects/HSC/
  DECam : https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/the-des-project/instrument/the-camera/
  MegaPrime : https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/Megacam/
  Latiss : https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/vera-c-rubin-observatory/rubin-auxtel/

Camera sensors are specified via their corners, which are assumed to form spherical
polygons.  The corners should be specified as gnomonic projections from the sphere to a
tangent plane in radians.  Multiple groups of sensors can compose the same camera.  For
example, LSSTCam has separate sensor groups for wavefront sensors, guider sensors, and
each of two types of science sensors.

Each camera is defined via a JSON file with the structure:

[
    {
        "name": "name-of-group-1",
        "corners": [
            [
                [corner1_x, corner1_y],
                [corner2_x, corner2_y],
                ...
            ], # sensor 1
            [
                ...
            ], # sensor 2
            ...
        ]
        "color": {
            "value": [R, G, B, alpha]
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "name-of-group-2",
        ...
    },
    ...
]

Cameras are loaded according to the order in

camera_order.json

which has the structure:
{
    "order": [
        "LSSTCam",
        "DECam",
        ...
    ]
}


TCP Server
==========
The mosaic camera plugin starts a TCP server listening on port 5772.  Messages can be
sent to the port in the format: "[name],[ra],[dec],[rot]" where [name] is the name of
one of the cameras, [ra] and [dec] indicate the camera boresight and [rot] the camera
rotation, all in degrees.
