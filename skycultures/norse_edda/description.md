# Norse (Edda)

## Culture Description
The Eddic myths were widespread in the North Germanic cultural area, which encompasses present-day Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland). They were written down in the 13th century in Iceland, with the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda representing the most important sources for Norse mythology. The culture referred to here therefore includes the North Germanic peoples before the 13th century.

The constellations described in the Rimtöl gloss (Persson 2017) occupy a special position, as they were recorded significantly later and in the context of Christianization. Nevertheless, these constellations can be reconciled well with Eddic myths. Holmberg (2022) further proposes the thesis that these constellations were already known at the time of the creation of the Rök runestone at the beginning of the 9th century.

Moreover, many of the constellations presented here are based on the work of Bjorn Jonsson (1994), who, in his analysis of the Edda, assumed the premise of a literal description of the sky. In principle, the entire work Star Myths of the Vikings could have been incorporated into the Stellarium. However, some of Jonsson’s claims are controversial and in parts seem far-fetched. For example, he assumes that Snorri Sturluson was familiar with ancient Indian astronomy because a Kali Yuga (a mythological-religious age in Indian tradition) appears in the Edda (Jonsson 1994, p. 13). A Kali Yuga lasts 432,000 years, and in the Edda, this number results from the description of Valhalla’s size by multiplying the 540 gates by the 800 people who can pass through each gate (Sturluson 2017, p. 50). Such speculative derivations have not only been criticized by other researchers but may also be incorrectly inferred (Lorenz 1984, p. 481).

Furthermore, Jonsson adopts the Mesopotamian zodiac and applies it directly to the Old Norse sky, although some of its stars are never visible in Northern Europe and some of the zodiac animals (e.g., Scorpio) are virtually unknown there. While many cultural influences from Mesopotamia certainly reached Northern Europe, this influence should not justify a one-to-one adoption of all constellations.


## Sky
The Eddic sagas constitute the most important documentation of Old Norse mythology, even though their origin remains disputed (Jonsson, 1994, p. 41). In recent decades, several attempts have been made to map the sagas of the Edda onto constellations in the night sky. As Sigurðsson (2022, p. 239) notes, the phenomena described by Snorri Sturluson are literally located in the heavens. In the Eddic cosmogony, the sky was created by the Æsir from the skull of the primeval giant Ymir, whom they had slain (Edda, p. 21). Subsequently, they took sparks that had flown from Muspellheim, the realm of fire, and set them in the sky as stars (Edda, p.22).

### Moon and Sun
Due to the geographical latitude at which many inhabitants of ancient Scandinavia lived, summers are very bright and winters very dark. At the latitude of Iceland, there are even several weeks in summer during which hardly any stars can be observed at night. Likewise, there are several weeks in winter when the sun is barely visible and the moon rises only a few degrees above the horizon. Under these unreliable conditions, it is unlikely that Old Norse peoples maintained detailed calendars based on the sun and moon. In Eddic mythology, the sun and moon are personified by the children of Mundilfari. The son, Mani, steers the course of the moon, and the daughter, Sol, that of the sun (Edda, p. 24). Neither may ever stop on their path, for both are pursued by wolves that wish to devour them. The wolf chasing the sun is called Sköll, and the one chasing the moon is called Hati. When Ragnarök, the downfall of the gods, begins, both will be devoured by the wolves (Edda, p. 25).

### Planets
There could be not found any valid sources for the old norse names for planets. 

### Zodiac
Considering that some parts of the zodiac are not visible at all throughout the year at Iceland’s latitude, and that almost no constellations can be observed during the summer, no attempt has been made here to include a zodiac. The same goes for a lunar system.

### Constellations
Aurvandils tá (Aurwandill’s toe) is the toe of the hero Aurwandill, which froze when he was carried by Thor across the icy river Eliwagar. Thor broke off the toe, cast it into the sky, and thereby transformed it into a star (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 111). Alongside Þjaza’s eyes, this is the only star explicitly mentioned in the Edda. Persson (2017) suggests Corona Borealis as the corresponding constellation. On the one hand, its shape resembles that of a toe; on the other, as a spring constellation, it allows an interpretation of the toe as a symbol of the victory of spring over winter (Persson, 2017).

Þjaza augu (Thiazi’s eyes) are the eyes of the giant Thiazi, who abducted the goddess Idun. The Æsir fought and killed Thiazi, and when his daughter sought revenge, Odin, as a sign of respect, cast Thiazi’s eyes into the sky, transforming them into stars (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 83). There is no concrete evidence as to which stars these might be, but the two bright and closely positioned stars Castor and Pollux are obvious candidates.

Bifrǫst (Bifröst) is the bridge that extends from the Earth to the heavens (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 26). The Æsir ride across Bifröst daily to the well of Urðr at the World Tree and hold council there (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 29). In literary scholarship, Bifröst is identified as a rainbow by day and as the Milky Way by night (Persson, 2017). However, the Milky Way is already well represented by the motif of Yggdrasil, and the translation of bifröst as “shimmering road” (Persson, 2017) could equally well be interpreted as a stellar formation. The arc-shaped group of stars from Pegasus to Daneb in the Milky Way closely resembles a bridge leading the Æsir to the well of Urðr at Yggdrasil.

Himinbjǫrg (Heimdall’s castle) is the structure standing on Bifröst and inhabited by the Æsir Heimdall, who has keen eyesight and guards the bridge against giants (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 39). The quadrilateral formed by Algenib, Markab, Alpheratz, and Scheat within the long arc conveys a clear image of a structure atop a bridge.

Úlfs Keptr (jaw of the wolf) is a constellation mentioned in the Rimtöl glosses and identified with the Hyades (Sigurðsson, 2022, p. 241). Wolves play a significant role in Old Norse mythology, as they are foretold to devour the sun and moon at Ragnarök (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 25). The Hyades lie along the moon’s path, and their V-shaped arrangement naturally invites comparison with a jaw snapping at the moon. Holmberg (2022, p. 18) further proposes that this wolf-jaw constellation may already have been recorded on the Rök Runestone in the early 9th century.

Þórs vagn (Thor’s chariot) is the chariot of the thunder god Thor, drawn by two goats (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 35). Thor, alongside Odin, was one of the principal deities in Old Norse mythology. Due to his strong connection to weather, he was crucial not only for seafaring but also for agriculture (Lorenz, 1984, p. 308). The shape of a chariot formed by the brightest stars of the Big Dipper lends itself well to association with Thor’s chariot. The Rimtöl gloss also records the constellation under the name Karlvagn or “man’s chariot” (Persson, 2017).

Freyju vagn (Freyja’s chariot) is the chariot of the fertility goddess Freyja, drawn by cats. When Freyja rides to a battlefield, she receives half of the slain warriors, the other half going to Odin (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 38). In the Rimtöl gloss, the small chariot is referred to as Kvennavagn, or “woman’s chariot” (Persson, 2017).

Freys sigð (Freyr’s sickle) belongs to the god Freyr, who governs rain and sunshine and thus the fertility of the earth. He is invoked for a good harvest (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 37). The star Spica (“ear of grain”) served as a calendar star for sowing and harvest in various cultures and periods. A constellation corresponding to a sickle fits into Old Norse mythology, as Freyr, for example, is depicted on an 11th-century runestone (Gotland Runic Inscription 181). The depicted shape is an approximation, but it can be traced through the brightness of the stars forming the sickle.

Þórr (Thor) was, alongside Odin, a central deity in Norse mythology. The two objects associated with him in the Edda are his hammer Mjöllnir and his belt, which doubles his strength (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 35). The constellation Orion was well known in the Middle Ages, and in various cultures figures holding objects were interpreted within it. The three bright belt stars are particularly prominent and could represent Thor’s belt of strength. Objects interpreted elsewhere as a shepherd’s staff (Babylonian) or sword (Greek) could here symbolize Thor’s hammer.

Ván is the river that flows from the mouth of Fenris after the Æsir bound him and inserted a sword into his jaws (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 44). Its proximity to Thor in this model is notable, as wading through rivers is a typical Thor motif (Lorenz, 1984, p. 253).

Asar Bardagi (battlefield of the Æsir) is mentioned in the Rimtöl gloss and equated with the constellation Auriga. The Edda recounts multiple battles involving the Æsir and daily skirmishes among Odin’s warriors, the einherjar, in Valhalla (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 51). Holmberg (2022, pp. 18–21) suggests possible references to the early 9th-century Rök Runestone, which also describes a battlefield, supporting the celestial interpretation.

Fiskikarlar (the fishermen) is a constellation preserved in the Rimtöl gloss. The name “fishermen” likely refers to the fishing episode in the Edda, where Thor and the giant Hymir fish for the Midgard Serpent using the head of the ox Himinhjǫrð (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 66). The legend predates the Rimtöl gloss, recorded already in the 10th century (Krause, 2010, p. 133). The identification of the constellation with Orion’s three belt stars fits the stellar culture, as Thor is both part of the fishermen in the myth and represented by the Orion constellation. Positioning the fishermen next to the Midgard Serpent and the ox’s head is consistent with representing the fishing episode in the sky.

Jormungandr (Midgard Serpent) is the serpent that spans the world in Eddic myths. As Thor’s adversary, it appears in the fishing episode (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 66). It can be associated with a constellation similar to Hydra, but in this model, stars visible from Iceland are used. The position along the Milky Way is notable, as Nidhögg lies beneath a root of Yggdrasil and gnaws at it. In this model, where the Milky Way represents Yggdrasil, Jormungandr could assume Nidhögg’s role.

Himinhjǫrð (ox’s head) is the largest ox in Hymir’s herd, which Thor beheads to use as bait for fishing the Midgard Serpent (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 65). The bright star Procyon, situated between Thor and the Midgard Serpent, provides a suitable reference point.

Rátatǫskr is the squirrel that scurries along the World Tree, carrying messages between Nidhögg, the serpent, and the eagle (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 30). Cassiopeia lies on the Milky Way between the constellations representing the eagle and the serpent.

Hræsvélgr (Hraesvelgr) is the giant in eagle form sitting at the edge of the sky, generating wind through the beating of his wings (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 33). The Edda also mentions an eagle perched in Yggdrasil (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 30). The constellation’s shape and position on the Milky Way fit this model, and the eagle is visible in the early evening during autumn, assigning Hraesvelgr a role as a sign of autumnal storms.

Hvergelmir (the boiling well) is one of the springs under Yggdrasil’s three roots. Nidhögg also dwells there, gnawing at the root (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 28). The wells are represented by gaps in the bright band of the Milky Way, with a larger dark area near Alhena corresponding to the serpent’s proximity.

Mímis brunnr (Mímir’s well) is the source of wisdom, from which Odin sacrificed his eye to drink (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 28). The wells are depicted by gaps in the bright band of the Milky Way, with the dark area near Vega serving as Mímir’s well, and Vega representing Odin’s sacrificed eye.

Urðarbrunnr (well of Urðr) is the spring at which the Æsir hold daily council. To reach it, they ride across Bifröst (Edda, 1997/2017, p. 28). The wells are again represented by gaps in the Milky Way, with a larger dark spot at the end of Bifröst near Daneb representing the spring beneath Yggdrasil’s root.


## About
The sources used for this paper can be found under ‘references’. Some constellations were derived from historical texts (e.g. Beckman and Kålund 1914–1916) and connected with other historical studies, such as research on the Rök runestone (Holmberg 2022, published 2025), and then related to the Eddic myths. Others were adopted as speculations proposed by different authors (Jonsson 1994), while still others are my own speculative interpretations.
