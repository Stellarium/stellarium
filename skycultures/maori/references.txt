NOTES:
Castor not pollux labelled Whakaahu

put in matariki as a star 17499, and set magnitudes to limit 4.0 so it can be seen

stars in Matariki also randomly labelled, just to get the names in.

put tekokota(hyades) in as a constellation

Jupiter and Saturn both have names Perearau, so labelled them Jupiter Perearau_1 and
saturn Perearau_2

Venus has two names, Meremere and Tawera, as there were separate names for the morning and evening stars.
Earth is named Papa.

In maori, double stars, optical or visual are called Pipiri, as an example Algieba is labelled Pipiri

-Te-Ra-o-Tainui: A maori constellation without a European counterpart.
This represents a waka, the belt of orion the keel,
the hyades, a claw sail and the Pleiades the bow.

-The individual star name Whakaahu either refers to A_Gem or B_Gem,thus
in this program A_Gem is taken as Whakaahu de to a second reference to
Stowell from Best(1955).

- Matariki refers to the Pleiades,
which technically, is not a single star but a star cluster made up dozens
of stars, six visible for naked eye observing, seven if great.

-WhitiKaupeka and Ruawahia are other Stowell references, A source
that does not fully correlate with Best.
