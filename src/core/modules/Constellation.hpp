//! @class Constellation
//! The Constellation class models a grouping of stars in a Sky Culture.
//! Each Constellation consists of a list of stars identified by their
//! abbreviation and Hipparcos catalogue numbers (taken from file: constellationship.fab),
//! another entry in file constellation_names.eng.fab with the defining abbreviated name,
//! nativeName, and translatable englishName (translation goes into nameI18).
//! GZ NEW: The nativeName should be accessible in a GUI option, so that e.g. original names as written in a
//! concrete book where a skyculture has been taken from can be assured even when translation is available.
//! TODO: There should be a distinction between constellations and asterisms, which are "unofficial" figures within a sky culture.
//! For example, Western sky culture has a "Big Dipper", "Coathanger", etc. These would be nice to see, but in different style.
