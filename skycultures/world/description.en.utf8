<h1>World</h1>
<p>The World sky culture (also known as Western by historical reasons) is used internationally by modern astronomers, 
and is the official scheme of The International Astronomical Union. 
It has historical roots in Ancient Greek astronomy, with influences from Islamic astronomy.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The World sky culture divides the celestial sphere into 88 areas of various sizes called constellations, 
each with precise boundary, issued by the International Astronomical Union in 1922. 
These constellations have become the standard way to describe the sky, replacing similar sets in other sky cultures exhaustively in daily usage.</p>
<p>The constellations in use today are based mainly on ancient Greek constellations depicted by Ptolemy in his book the Almagest during the 2nd century CE. 
In the subsequent centuries, this book has been translated from Greek into Arabic (6th to 9th century) and later to medieval Latin. 
In the Arabic more than in the Latin tradition, the Ptolemaic figures were enriched and transformed by native Arabic constellations and star names.</p>
<p>In the 18th century, European astronomers suggested new constellations to fill the gaps between northern constellations 
(e.g. the constellation of "the lynx" for an area close to the Great Bear but with stars so faint that you would need the eyes of a lynx to see them) 
and also created new constellations in the southern part of the sky which had not been visible to Ptolemy. 
These new constellations were usually named after new technical inventions of the early modern period 
(e.g. a chemical machine, a balloon, an air pump) or exotic animals (e.g. a chamaeleon, a tucan, a paradise bird). 
Among them many constellations were also named with political consideration to honor certain kings or patrons.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the 20th century, the IAU (International Astronomical Union) aimed for a large clean-up: 
in 1922, it officially accepted the list of 88 constellation names. In 1928 it also defined precise constellation boundaries [#40] still in use today.</p>

<h2>Extras</h2>
<p>In the 2nd century CE, Ptolemy in Alexandria published a multi-volume book which summarised the knowledge of the time, 
rooted in a tradition of mathematical astronomy since Hipparchus (at least 265 year earlier). In the subsequent centuries, 
this book has been translated from Greek into Arabic (6th to 9th century), from Arabic into Latin, and later, from the original ancient Greek into medieval Latin. 
Due to this transformation, it is now known under the artificial name Almagest, derived from the Arabic title [#46].</p>
<p>The Almagest's star catalogue (book VII and VIII) has been depicted many times in the Islamic as well as in the Christian astronomical traditions. 
Often, the figures were re-drawn in order to adapt them to the taste of art of the epoch. In the Arabic more than in the Latin tradition, 
the Ptolemaic figures were enriched and transformed by native Arabic constellations and star names. 
Therefore, this sky culture displays a modern descendant of the Ptolemaic one with traces of translations, misunderstandings, transformations, and purposly additions.</p>
<p>In 1603 the lawyer and hobby astronomer Johann Bayer from Augsburg, Germany, made a new celestial atlas, called Uranometria [#41]. 
In this atlas, he introduced a systematic naming of stars starting with alpha, the brightest, beta, the second brightest, gamma, the third ... within a constellation. 
Subsequently, it was established to name a star with a Greek letter and the Latin constellation name in casus genitive.</p>
<p>In the 18th century, the century of great atlases (Flamsteed, Fortin, Bode: [#42][#43]), new constellations were added to fill the gaps between northern constellations. 
Additionally, there were suggestions to create new constellations in the southern part of the sky which had not been visible to Ptolemy. 
European astronomers visited the European colonies and instead of asking the native people for their constellations, the Europeans were creative. 
This way, many new technical inventions of the early modern period were depicted in constellations (e.g. a chemical machine, a balloon, an air pump) 
as well as exotic animals (e.g. a chamaeleon, a tucan, a paradise bird).</p>
<p>The problem was that sometimes astronomers did not agree with each other and, thus, atlases showed deviations from each other.</p>
<p>After many centuries of astronomers taking liberties in interpretation of the Ptolemaic original, there were many variants of constellations. 
As constellations are a positioning system, i.e. astronomers describe positions in the sky relative to stars and stars relative to constellations 
(like "Betelgeuse", Orion's right shoulder), it is necessary to use constellation names and star names uniformly all over the world.</p>
<p>In the "Fin de si√®cle", there were upcoming suggestions in the IAU to unify the system of constellations and star names [#44].</p>
<p>As the IAU in 1928 only defined the boundaries of these areas [#43] and not the way of drawing artwork within them, 
several sub-cultures of painting figures and drawing simplified stickfigures were developed during the 20th and 21st century. 
We provide some of them as further sky cultures.</p>

<h3>Constellations</h3>
<p>These constellations are based mainly on the Ptolemaic tradition which had been used in all three Abrahamitic religions and, 
thus, was common in the Near East, in Europe and its colonies on all continents. 
However, between the ancient Greek constellations there were gaps of areas with only faint stars belonging to no constellation.[#47] 
In the Modern Epoch, several astronomers suggested constellation figures for these gaps 
(e.g. the constellation of "the lynx" for an area close to the Great Bear but with stars so faint that you would need the eyes of a lynx to see them), 
among them many political constellations to the honor of certain kings or patrons. In the beginning of the 20th century, the IAU aimed for a huge clean-up.</p>
<p>In 1922, the IAU officially accepted the list of 88 constellation names and their official abbreviations with three letters. 
The only remaining political constellations is Scutum, the shield of a Polish king but without mentioning the political reference anymore. 
The Belgian priest E. Delporte got the task to define constellation boundaries according to coordinates. 
In 1928, he finished the work and the IAU accepted his delimitations [#40].</p>
<p>These "constellations" are naked areas in the sky without any stick figures or depictions [#44]. 
The borders simply follow the lines of right ascension and declination. 
These constellations became the standard way to describe the sky, replacing similar sets in other sky cultures exhaustively in daily usage.</p>
<p>Stellarium by default displays the precise RA-DEC-boundaries and a set of artwork constellations on the basis of Ptolemaic figures but following our contemporary taste of art.</p>

<h3>Proper names of stars</h3>
<p>Ptolemy's star catalogue had the layout of a table listing the description of the star's position in the constellation's figure, the ecliptical coordinates, 
and the magnitude e.g.: "The star at the tip of the tail of Ursa Minor", "Gem 0 1/6, +66", "Mag 3".</p>
<p>In most cases, the star names evolved by astronomer's systematical abbreviations of these descriptions, 
e.g. first astronomer abbreviated in a text "tip of the tail", a next astronomer drew a map with less space and wrote only "tail" next to the star and this name remained. 
With centuries, these descriptions were translated into Arabic and Latin, and in some cases the translators or writers make mistakes because of misreading 
or misspelling or the Arabic words (e.g. the Arabic "yad al gauza", the hand of the giant woman, to the common term "Betelgeuse").</p>
<p>However, there are also a few original Greek words like the red star "Antares", the counterpart of Ares (Mars) and even a few original Babylonian terms like "Shargaz", the Sting, in Scorpius. 
Our modern, most recent IAU star names [#45] are a huge mixture, also with influences or even politically wanted additions of star names from the none-Ptolemaic sky cultures, 
e.g. the traditional Pingsing, a Chinese star name for a star in Hydra (its meaning is only "star", a reminescence to his lonely position) or newly adopted star names from Polynesian, 
Hawaiian, or Aboriginal cultures for names of stars with exoplanets.</p>
