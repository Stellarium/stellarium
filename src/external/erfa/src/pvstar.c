**  Convert star position+velocity vector to catalog coordinates.

**  Given (Note 1):
**     pv     double[2][3]   pv-vector (au, au/day)
**
**  Returned (Note 2):
**     ra     double         right ascension (radians)
**     dec    double         declination (radians)
**     pmr    double         RA proper motion (radians/year)
**     pmd    double         Dec proper motion (radians/year)
**     px     double         parallax (arcsec)
**     rv     double         radial velocity (km/s, positive = receding)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**            int            status:
**                              0 = OK
**                             -1 = superluminal speed (Note 5)
**                             -2 = null position vector
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The specified pv-vector is the coordinate direction (and its rate
**     of change) for the date at which the light leaving the star
**     reached the solar-system barycenter.
**
**  2) The star data returned by this function are "observables" for an
**     imaginary observer at the solar-system barycenter.  Proper motion
**     and radial velocity are, strictly, in terms of barycentric
**     coordinate time, TCB.  For most practical applications, it is
**     permissible to neglect the distinction between TCB and ordinary
**     "proper" time on Earth (TT/TAI).  The result will, as a rule, be
**     limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the proper-motion and
**     radial-velocity data;  moreover, the supplied pv-vector is likely
**     to be merely an intermediate result (for example generated by the
**     function eraStarpv), so that a change of time unit will cancel
**     out overall.
**
**     In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
**     right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
**     secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
**     equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.
**
**     Summarizing, the specified pv-vector is for most stars almost
**     identical to the result of applying the standard geometrical
**     "space motion" transformation to the catalog data.  The
**     differences, which are the subject of the Stumpff paper cited
**     below, are:
**
**     (i) In stars with significant radial velocity and proper motion,
**     the constantly changing light-time distorts the apparent proper
**     motion.  Note that this is a classical, not a relativistic,
**     effect.
**
**     (ii) The transformation complies with special relativity.
**
**  3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
**     and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
**     parallax is in arcseconds; the radial velocity is in km/s, but
**     the pv-vector result is in au and au/day.
**
**  4) The proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension
**     and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per Julian
**     year.  The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not
**     true angle, and will thus be numerically larger at high
**     declinations.
**
**  5) Straight-line motion at constant speed in the inertial frame is
**     assumed.  If the speed is greater than or equal to the speed of
**     light, the function aborts with an error status.
**
**  6) The inverse transformation is performed by the function eraStarpv.
**
**  Called:
**     eraPn        decompose p-vector into modulus and direction
**     eraPdp       scalar product of two p-vectors
**     eraSxp       multiply p-vector by scalar
**     eraPmp       p-vector minus p-vector
**     eraPm        modulus of p-vector
**     eraPpp       p-vector plus p-vector
**     eraPv2s      pv-vector to spherical
**     eraAnp       normalize angle into range 0 to 2pi
