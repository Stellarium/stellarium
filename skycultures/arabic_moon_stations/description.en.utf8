<h2>Arabic Moon Stations</h2>
<p>The Arabic Moon stations sky culture describes the 28 sky areas
chosen in ancient Arabia to define the daily location of the moon
during its lunar month trip around the sky. The sun also passes
through these stations spending around 13 to 14 days in the
neighborhood of each station, completing 27 x 13 + 14 (One of the
stations is assigned 14 days) = 365 days in its yearly trip around the
28 stations.</p>

<p>Each station is recognized by a star or a group of stars.</p>

<h3>Historical Overview</h3>

<p><em>Manazil al-Qamar</em>, Arabic for the lunar mansions, or stations of the
moon is a system of 28 stars, group of stars, or spots in the sky near
which the moon is found in each of the 28 nights of its monthly
revolution. This system was adopted by the Arabs in the pre-Islamic
period, prior to 7th century of the common era. Early mentions of the
complete list of the lunar stations is reported by Abd al-Malik Ibn
Habeeb (d. 852) on the authority of Malik ibn Anas
(d. 795).<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>

<p>This system was used to fix seasons and predict weather, especially
rain.<sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup> The Arabs said:
each <em>Naw</em> [period of 13/14 days] is characterized by a
distinctive weather pattern of rain, wind and
temperature.<sup><a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></sup> The solar year is
divided into 28 periods of 13 days each except for one period that is
given 14 days, with a total of 365 days. These 28
thirteen-day/fourteen-day periods are called <em>Anwa'a</em>, plural of
<em>Naw'</em>. Each <em>Naw</em> starts at the setting of one of the
stars or asterisms, which compose a moon mansion in the west at dawn
of morning and the rising of its opposite moon mansion, at the same
time, in the east. The <em>Naw</em> is given the name of the setting moon
mansion. The setting and rising for each of the 28 moon mansions, one
after the other, makes a solar year. <em>Al-Jabhah</em> moon mansion is
assigned 14
days.<sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>

<p>A detailed description of the stars of each moon mansion, the times
of their heliacal rising and a compilation of astronomical and
meteorological knowledge of the ancient Arabs can be found in
the <em>Book of Anwaa</em>, authored by Ibn Qutaybah (b. 828 - d. 884
or 889). Copies of this book manuscripts survived, and it was printed
in India in 1956.<sup><a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Use of the moon mansions continued, and because of the importance
of identifying them and the times of their heliacal risings, Poems had
been composed describing them and short treatises had been written to
identify them and suggest the agricultural, travel and medicine
practices associated with each mansion. An example poem dedicated to
description of the stars of the moon mansions attributed to Muhammad
al-Mukri (1578-1638) had been published by Gustave-Adolphe de
Calassanti-Motylinski in 1899 in his book "Les mansions lunaires chez
les
Arabes".<sup><a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#footnote-7">[7]</a></sup>
A sample treatise is the one written by Shaikh Salih Al-Shethri
(d. ~1891), titled "A time-table for
farmers".<sup><a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a></sup> </p>

<h3>Current Use of Moon Stations</h3>
<p>Agricultural almanacs based on the heliacal rising of moon stations
are still in active use today. The official calendar of Saudi Arabia
includes these times.<sup><a href="#footnote-9">[9]</a></sup> The
following is an example of the use of a moon stations based calendar for
the 13 day period starting with the rise of the 3rd moon station
<em>Al-Thurayya</em> (Pleiades) on June 7th: "Weather gets hotter and
wind gets stronger. Wild grasses dries. Water in wells gets
shallower. Rain is rare during this time. Spring insects start to
disappear. Palm tree dates starts to get its colors. It is recommended
to irrigate trees with the right amounts and stop irrigation of vines
when grapes starts to take its
color."<sup><a href="#footnote-10">[10]</a></sup> </p>

<h3>Identification of the Moon Stations</h3>
<p> Ibn Qutabah (b. 828 - d. 884 or 889) in his <em>Book of Anwaa</em> gives
detailed description of the stars of each moon station, but an
accurate identification can be extracted from the <em>Book of Fixed Stars</em>
by Al-Sufi (d. 986). In his book Al-Sufi maps the stars as known to
ancient Arabs to those of the Ptolemaic Constellations.</p> 

<p>An example of Al-Sufi definitions of the stars of the moon
mansions, this definition of <em>Al-Ghafr</em>: "And the 22nd [star of
Virgo] and the 23rd which is on the tail [hem of the garment] with the
25th on the left foot [of Virgo] are named [by the
Arabs] <em>Al-Ghafr</em> which is the 15th moon
mansion."<sup><a href="#footnote-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><a href="#footnote-12">[12]</a></sup>. Because
the star numbers of the Ptolemaic constellations have known
coordinates, it is relatively easy to recognize the corresponding Arab
star names.</p>

<h3>Notes on star names and the Asterisms of the Moon Stations Sky Culture</h3>
<p>Ancient Arabs frequently gave a name to a group of stars, for
example, the 3 stars at the belt of Orion (δ_Ori, ε_Ori and ζ_Ori), are
named "String of beads" <em>al-Nazhm</em> (النظم). In this sky culture they are designated
as "String of beads 1", "String of beads 2" and "String of beads 3".</p>

<p>All star names in this sky culture are of ancient Arabic origin,
prior to Hellenistic influence, that has been reported by Al-Sufi in
his <em>Book of the Fixed Stars</em>, with the addition of the
following star names:
<ol>
 <li>The Oath star, α_Eri  <em>al-Muhlif</em>  (المحلف): This star was not reported by
     Ptolemy or Al-Sufi because it couldn't be seen from their
     northern latitude. Prof. Kunitzsch concluded that it's the star
     named <em>al-Muhnith</em>  (المحنث) which was mentioned in some early
     resources.<sup><a href="#footnote-13">[13]</a></sup> This star is
     still known in the Arabian peninsula and has the name of <em>al-Muhlif</em>
     (المحلف) with the same meaning.</li>
 <li>The Two first ones, α_UMa and β_UMa  <em>al-Awwalaan</em> (الأولان): This name of this
     pair of stars is mentioned by the seafarer Ibn Majid
     (d. ~1500).<sup><a href="#footnote-14">[14]</a></sup> The name is
     still in use by fishermen of the Red sea.</li>
<li>The Obscure one, δ_UMa <em>al-Khafi</em> (الخافي): This name is mentioned by the
    seafarer Ibn Majid
    (d. ~1500).<sup><a href="#footnote-15">[15]</a></sup></li>
<li>The gazelles, 42_Ori, θ2_Ori and ι_Ori <em>al-Jawazi</em> (الجوازي): This name was
    reported by Ibn Qutaybah in his book of
    Anwaa.<sup><a href="#footnote-16">[16]</a></sup></li>
<li>The Shepherd of the Ostriches, λ_Sgr <em>Ra'i al-Nayyem</em> (راعي النعايم): This star is
    the 9th star of the 20th moon station according to the Poems of
    Muhammad al-Mukrī<sup><a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a></sup> and
    Mohammad al-Qadhi<sup><a href="#footnote-22">[22]</a></sup> See
    Kunitzsch for the source of this
    name.<sup><a href="#footnote-25">[25]</a></sup></li>
</ol></p>

<p>In translating the meanings of the star names to English, I have
tried my best to select the meaning that is more appropriate when the
name can have several meanings. The following meanings are worth
mentioning because it can be different from meanings previously seen
in resources of Arabic star names:
<ol>
 <li> Star α_Aur (Capella): ancient Arabic name is <em>al-Ayyuq</em>
      (العيوق) as reported by Al-Sufi, Ibn Qutaybah and others. The
      meaning of this name is "The Obstructor". In Old Arabic
      lexicons, The "obstructor" comes from the legend
      that <em>al-Ayyuq</em> is obstructing Aldebaran from meeting
      <em>al-Thurayya</em> (the
      Pleiades).<sup><a href="#footnote-17">[17]</a></sup><sup><a href="#footnote-18">[18]</a></sup></li>
 <li> Star ε_UMa (Alioth): ancient Arabic name is <em>al-Jawn</em> (الجون) as
      reported by Al-Sufi. This name has several meanings and usually
      refers to the black color of a horse or a camel. Kunitzsch gave
      the meaning in German as "der Rappe", meaning black horse, but
      this name also means "white wild donkey" or "wild ass". Because this
      star is relatively bright, I preferred the meaning of "wild
      donkey".<sup><a href="#footnote-19">[19]</a></sup><sup><a href="#footnote-20">[20]</a></sup></li>
 <li> Stars λ_Ori, φ1_Ori and φ2_Ori: ancient Arabic name is <em>al-Hakaah</em>
      (الهقعة) as reported by Al-Sufi, Ibn Qutaybah and others. This
      name means "the circle on the chest" or "the side of the chest" or
      "the spot at the foot of the rider" that is formed by hair taking
      different directions on the body of the horse. I found the poem
      of Muhammad al-Mukrī describes these stars by the spot at the
      side of the horse near the foot of the
      rider.<sup><a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a></sup> Kunitzsch also
      mentioned this meaning in "A Dictionary of Modern Star
      Names".<sup><a href="#footnote-21">[21]</a></sup></li>
</ol></p>

<p> The asterisms of the moon stations in this sky culture are defined along the identifications reported by al-Sufi with the following notes:
<ol>
 <li>The 4th moon station <em>Al-Dabaran</em> (The Follower [of the Pleiades])
     is composed of one star α_Tau (Aldebaran) according to al-Sufi
     and Ibn Qutaybah. I added to it the V-shaped stars of the Hyades
     cluster which is the way it is described in the poem of Muhammad
     al-Mukrī<sup><a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a></sup> and another poem
     of Mohammad al-Qadhi
     (d. ~1868)<sup><a href="#footnote-22">[22]</a></sup>.</li>
 <li> The 8th moon station <em>Al-Nathrah</em> (The tip of the nose of the
     lion) is composed of the Praesepe cluster according to
     al-Sufi. Ibn Qutaybah adds to the cluster the two stars γ Cnc
     (Asellus Borealis) and δ Cnc (Asellus
     Australis).<sup><a href="#footnote-23">[23]</a></sup></li>
 <li> The 20th moon station <em>Al-Naayem</em> (The Ostriches) is the
     area around the stars: ζ Sgr (Ascella), φ Sgr, δ Sgr (Kaus Media)
     and ε Sgr (Kaus Australis) according to al-Sufi. Ibn Qutaybah
     describes this moon station as composed of 8 stars: ς_Sgr, φ_Sgr,
     τ_Sgr, ζ_Sgr, γ_Sgr, δ_Sgr, ε_Sgr,
     η_Sgr.<sup><a href="#footnote-24">[24]</a></sup> The Poems of
     Muhammad al-Mukrī<sup><a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a></sup> and
     Mohammad al-Qadhi<sup><a href="#footnote-22">[22]</a></sup> adds
     a 9th star λ_Sgr.</li>
 <li>The 21th moon station <em>Al-Baldah</em> (The empty area) is the
     area where there are no bright stars between <em>Al-Naayem</em>
     and <em>Saad Al-Thabih</em>. I made an asterism of stars around
     this spot.</li>

</ol>

<h3>The Superlion and Al-Jawza figures of the ancient Arab star lore</h3>
<p>One may notice from the names of the 7th to the 15th moon stations
that they are part of a lion figure. This Arab lion figure covers
around 100 degrees, a little bit more than half the sky dome. From the
names of these stars a lion figure can be constructed.</p>

<p>Two of the moon stations, <em>Al-Hakaah</em> and <em>Al-Hanaah</em>, are part of Al-Jawza stars. Al-Jawza is
the figure covering Orion plus some stars around it. The ancient Arabs
imagined these stars as a figure of a woman with a bow and arrow aimed
at the lion.</p>

<p>Mr Roland Laffitte discussed these two figures and offered a
depiction of each in his
article: <a href="http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/our-arab-heritage-celestial-vault"
class='external text' rel="nofollow">Our Arab Heritage in the
Celestial Vault</a>. A more detailed discussion of ancient Arab star
lore is found in his book: "Le Ciel des Arabes"</p>
