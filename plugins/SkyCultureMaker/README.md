# Sky Culture Maker Plugin

## Introduction

*Sky Culture Maker* is a plugin for **Stellarium**, designed to simplify the creation and customization of sky cultures. With this tool, users can easily define new sky cultures, draw constellations, and visualize their arrangements directly within Stellarium.

The plugin provides an intuitive interface for both amateur astronomers and advanced users to:
- Create and edit sky cultures without extensive manual configuration  
- Define new constellations by drawing directly in the Stellarium sky view  
- convert .fab data  
- Contribute to educational projects, preserve cultural astronomical knowledge, or create personalized star maps  

This documentation explains how to install, configure, and use the Sky Culture Maker plugin effectively.

## 2. Getting Started

Sky Culture Maker provides a seamless workflow to create custom sky cultures directly within Stellarium. This section will guide you through the initial steps to get familiar with the interface and start creating your first sky culture.


### Overview of the User Interface

Once the plugin is activated, you can access it through the Stellarium toolbar. By clicking on **Create**, the main window will open, providing several tabs, each dedicated to different aspects of sky culture creation:

- **Overview:** Manage constellations, remove existing ones, and save your sky culture. The license must be specified here.  
- **Description:** Enter essential metadata like the sky culture's name, description, and author. See the [Stellarium Guide](https://stellarium.org/files/guide.pdf) for details on recommended attributes.  
- **Boundaries:** (Work in progress) Define boundaries for constellations or cultural sky regions.  
- **Common Names:** (Work in progress) Specify alternative names or traditional star names.  
- **Geolocation:** (Work in progress) Assign geographic or cultural origin information.

### Creating a New Sky Culture

1. Open the Sky Culture Maker interface.  
2. Click **Create New Sky Culture**.  
3. Fill in the required fields under the **Description** tab (name, author, etc.).  
4. Set the license in the **Overview** tab.  

Once the basic information is complete, you can begin drawing constellations.

### Drawing Constellations

The constellation editor provides tools for interactive design:

- **Pen Tool:** Click on stars to draw constellation lines between points.  
- **Erase Tool:** Remove lines or incorrect segments from the constellation.  
- **Undo:** Revert the most recent drawing action.  

For each constellation, the following information must be provided:

- **ID:** Unique identifier for the constellation  
- **Name:** Display name for the constellation  
- **Native Name (optional):** Name in the original language or script  
- **Pronunciation (optional):** Phonetic pronunciation guide  
- **Constellation Image (optional):** Upload an image to be anchored to the constellation  

If your constellation consists of multiple separated areas, disable the pen tool after completing one area to unlock the drawing cursor from the most recent star.

### Exporting Your Sky Culture

*This section is under construction.*  
You will be able to export the entire sky culture package for use within Stellarium or distribution to others. The export process will generate all required files and directory structures automatically.

## 3. File Structure and Output**

SkyCultureMaker/
- CMakeLists.txt, README.md, icons.svg 
- resources/
	- icons
	- SkyCultureMaker.qrc

	- main classes 
	- gui/
		- dialogue & windows (Scm*.cpp/hpp)
		- UI-definitions(.ui)

## 4. Best Practices

### Recommended Naming Conventions

- Follow the standards outlined in the [Stellarium Guide](https://stellarium.org/files/guide.pdf)  
- Use consistent and culturally appropriate names for constellations  
- Ensure unique IDs for each constellation  

### Tips for Accurate Constellation Design

- When drawing constellations with separate, disconnected regions, disable the pen tool after completing one area to prevent lines from unintentionally connecting distant stars.  
- Use high-contrast colors for constellation lines to ensure visibility in Stellarium's sky view.  
- Anchor images carefully to avoid visual misalignment during zooming or panning.  
- Zooming in on the sky allows for more precise use of the pen tool. The star selection becomes less sensitive to nearby stars, making it easier to accurately connect the intended points.
