//! @class AstroCalcChart
//! This class extends QChart and encapsulates data for the Altitude vs. Time and the other line Charts in AstroCalcDialog.
//! Most lines can be QSplineSeries, however the azimuth and magnitude lines must use QLineSeries to avoid a "spline tremor" at the 0/360Â° transition or where some moon enters the shadow of its planet.
//!
//! Additional features:
//! - Mouse-over on series provides date/value information in a tooltip
//! - Left mouse click sets date/time of click point.
//!
//! The correct sequence of use:
//! - create with the possible series you are going to use
//! - fill the series with values with append(). The X value is milliseconds from Epoch (1970).
//! - add horizontal/vertical lines with addTrivial[YX]Line(series)
//! - call show(series)
//! - scale the Y axes:
//! -- You can retrieve the actual min/max values from findYRange(series). Apply any manual limits last.
//! -- call setYrange(series, min, max) and setYrangeR(series, min, max) where needed. Use real min/max. A series-dependent buffer will be added.
//! - call setupAxes()
//! - use setChart() to display chart in a chartView. A previous chart must be retrieved and deleted!
//!
//! The time coordinate is displayed using a QDateTimeAxis. Given slight differences between QDateTime and Stellarium's understanding of timezones etc.,
//!  we must circumvent Qt's automatic handling of local timezones and work as if the time axis would display UTC dates, however, the actual data are in our own timezone frame.
//! This requires manipulation of the x values: From the data which are computed in JD, plot them in UT+zoneOffset. Clicked time is delivered as "UT" and must add zoneOffset as well.
//!
//! @note We are using QDateTime here. Currently we have no handling for years before AD1. Qt has no year zero, we have it. Qt time scaling may also show use of Proleptic Gregorian calendars.
//! We must expect to see a few weird dates before AD1 or even before 1582.
