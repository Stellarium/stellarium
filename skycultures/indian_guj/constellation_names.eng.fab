# Note from the user guide at https://launchpadlibrarian.net/330148407/stellarium_user_guide-0.16.0-1.pdf:

# The native constellations are listed in constellation_names.eng.fab. It consists of 3 simple
# columns: Abbreviation(or just a serial number), native name, and english translation. The writing
# _("name") allows automatic translation of the English strings to other languages. These strings
# will be used as constellation labels.
# The first column (abbreviation) in the Western sky culture provides the canonical 3-letter
# abbreviation for constellations as used by the International Astronomical Union. Such abbreviations
# may not be available for the skyculture you are working with, so you must invent your own. These
# abbreviations are used as keys in the other files, so they must be unique within your skyculture. It
# is not necessary to have 3-letter keys.
# The keys can be displayed on screen when labels are requested in the Starlore GUI (section
# 4.4.5). If you want to prevent certain abbreviations from being displayed, let them start with a
# dot. See the effect in the Western (H.A.Rey) skyculture: In Abbreviated mode, only the official
# abbreviations are displayed. In Native mode, the second column of constellation_names.eng.fab
# is shown. Only with setting Translated , the text translated from the text shown in the third column
# is shown. If your skyculture is a variant of the Western skyculture, please use the canonical Latin
# names, they have all been translated already.
# If your skyculture is not a variant of the generally known Western skyculture, please include an
# English translation to the name given in the native language. Else translators will not be able to
# translate the name

# We use IAST transliteration for unambious transliteration of devanAgarI using latin alphabets, while using phonetically more intuitive equivalents in suggested translations.
