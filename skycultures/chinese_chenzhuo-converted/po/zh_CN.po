"### The Evolution of Chen Zhuo Constellations\n"
"\n"
"The integration of the Three Schools constellations by Chen Zhuo (230s-320s "
"CE) is a milestone in the history of Chinese astronomy. The \"Three Schools "
"constellations\" refer to those created by Shi school, Gan school, and Wu "
"Xian school, named after Shishen (石申) and Gande (甘德) from the Warring "
"States period and Wuxian (巫咸), a legendary astronomer from the Shang "
"dynasty (1600 BCE - 1046 BCE). Research suggests the formation of these "
"constellation systems occurred during the Han Dynasty (202 BCE - 220 CE). "
"Later, during the Three Kingdoms (220 CE - 280 CE) or Western Jin (265 CE - "
"316 CE) period, the Grand Historian Chen Zhuo synthesized these traditions "
"into a new system, encompassing 283 constellations and 1,464 stars.\n"
"\n"
"However, over this long transmission period, the positions and shapes of "
"Chen Zhuo constellations underwent noticeable changes due to transcription "
"errors on star maps. The Northern Song constellations, as reflected in the "
"Huangyou Star Catalog, the *Xin yixiang fayao* star map, and the Suzhou Star "
"Map already show clear differences from those of Chen Zhuo and the original "
"Three Schools in Han dynasty.\n"
"\n"
"### Reconstruction of the Earliest Chen Zhuo Constellations\n"
"\n"
"The primary works of Chen Zhuo and the Three Schools have been lost, and "
"much of the early documentation of their constellations is no longer extant. "
"While some data from the Shi school survived in Tang dynasty texts like the "
"*Kaiyuan zhanjing* (开元占经, Divination Canon of Kaiyuan Reign) and the "
"*Tiandi ruixiangzhi* (天地瑞祥志, Treatise on Celestial and Terrestrial "
"Omens), early positional descriptions for the Gande and Wuxian "
"constellations exist only in fragments. This scarcity of materials has long "
"hindered scholars' efforts to reconstruct and understand early Chinese sky.\n"
"\n"
"Recently, Boshun YANG discovered new records of stellar coordinates that "
"differ from previously known star catalogs like Jingyou and Huangyou. These "
"records encompass the 28 lodges (xiu) as well as constellations from the "
"three schools. After research, he found it is a star catalog formed by Chen "
"Zhuo based on the integration of the coordinate data of the three schools in "
"the Han Dynasty. The Shi School data not only correct Tang Dynasty records "
"but also include previously unrecorded information. More significantly, the "
"Gande and Wuxian data are entirely novel and originate from Han dynasty "
"observations. Further research indicates that these data were primarily "
"observed during the Han Dynasty, aligning well with descriptions in the "
"*Three Schools’ Star Canons* and early star maps like the *Cheonsang Yeolcha "
"Bunyajido*, the Dunhuang Star Map, and the *Gezi yuejin tu*. This discovery "
"has proven crucial for reconstructing the early Chinese sky.\n"
"\n"
"The majority of the early celestial officials can be reliably restored by "
"combining the Chen Zhuo catalogue, the *Three Schools’ Star Canons*, and the "
"early star maps. Due to the errors in the star tables and maps, as well as "
"the ambiguity in the early text descriptions, a small number of "
"constellations may require further improvement.\n"
"\n"
"### Scientific Value and Cultural Significance of Early Constellations\n"
"\n"
"The Chinese constellation system offers unique contributions to modern "
"astronomical research. Ancient Chinese astronomers conducted detailed and "
"prolonged observations, leaving extensive records of phenomena like meteors, "
"comets, guest stars, and auroras, all referenced against constellations. "
"Restoring early constellations aids in accurately locating these events, "
"enhancing the application of ancient records in contemporary astronomy. For "
"instance, the early Purple Palace in this sky culture has been instrumental "
"in identifying the ancient counterpart of the nova remnant Z Cam.\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture preserves the original appearances and positions of "
"numerous star groupings, with some examples highlighted below.\n"
"\n"
" - **Shape**: The *Huagai* (华盖, Canopy of the Emperor) constellation "
"initially resembled some ceremonial parasols used by Han emperors, while "
"later depictions evolved into circular or irregular shapes, losing their "
"cultural connotation. The *Neijie* (内阶, Inner Steps) was modeled after the "
"*Santai* (三台, Three Steps; also known as *Tianjie* (天阶, the Heavenly "
"Steps); they serve as paths that connected the *Zigong* (紫宫, Purple "
"Palace), *Taiwei* (太微, Supreme Palace), and *Wenchang* (文昌, "
"Administrative Centre), symbolizing imperial pathways. Thus, it has a shape "
"of staircase.\n"
" - **Position**: The *Tianfu* (天桴, Celestial Drumstick) was originally "
"located near the *Hegu* (河鼓, Drum at the River) and this position is in "
"line with its astrological meaning. Over time, it was gradually moved "
"downward, and its connection with *Hegu* gradually weakened. Similarly, the "
"*Lishi* (砺石, Whetstone) was initially placed near the *Wuche* (五车, Five "
"Chariots), whose northwest star, *Tianku* (天库, Celestial Arsenal), "
"represented generals and military affairs. Since *Lishi* can sharpen blades, "
"it was located below *Tianku* to assist it, aiming to make weapons sharp and "
"achieve victory. After the Song dynasty, the Whetstone moved near the "
"*Juanshe* (卷舌, Rolled Tongue), diverging from its original intent.\n"
"\n"
"The initial shapes and arrangements of the Three Schools constellations were "
"meticulously designed by their creators, with some configurations mirroring "
"the forms of real-world objects, and spatial relationships encoding "
"astrological meanings. These original meanings were often lost as the "
"constellations evolved over time.\n"
"\n"
"This sky culture is thus invaluable for uncovering the original scientific "
"and cultural meanings embedded in early Chinese constellations."

"### 陈卓星官的演化\n"
"\n"
"陈卓（230年代-320年代）总三家星官是中国天文学史上一件里程碑式的重要事件。三家"
"星官分别指石氏、甘氏、巫咸三家，是中国星官的主要来源，分别托名于战国天文学家"
"石申夫、甘德以及商代天文学家巫咸。三家星官形成时间，经学界研究，当定为汉代；"
"三家星官形成之后，在三国或西晋时由太史令陈卓汇为新体系，共计283星官，1464颗"
"星。此后，中国官方所使用的星官名称以及每一星官所含星数基本定型；陈卓（三家）"
"星官被后世历代王朝奉为正统，通过浑象、星图等载体不断传承，沿用一千三百多年，"
"直至明末欧洲天文学传入之后方才发生重大的体系变化。\n"
"\n"
"不过，在一千三百多年流传过程中，由于星图传抄讹变等种种原因，陈卓星官在位置、"
"形态上皆发生了一系列较为明显的演变。皇祐星表、《新仪象法要》星图以及苏州石刻"
"天文图共同反映的北宋星官与陈卓乃至汉代的三家星官已有明显不同。\n"
"\n"
"### 陈卓三家星官的复原\n"
"\n"
"三家及陈卓的主要著作皆已散佚，其中记录早期星象的图表资料亦多不存。虽然石氏学"
"派的星官数据通过《开元占经》《天地瑞祥志》等唐代著作有幸留存下来，但甘氏、巫"
"咸星官的早期位置记录却仅剩只言片语。资料的缺乏，使得其形成年代至今未有定论，"
"也给学界复原、理解中国早期星空带来严重的障碍。\n"
"\n"
"近年，杨伯顺发现了一批新的恒星观测记录，这批数据与以往所知的景祐、皇祐等星表"
"均不相同，涵盖二十八宿以及石氏、甘氏、巫咸三家星官，经考证为陈卓汇总的三家星"
"表。其中石氏星官数据不仅可以对唐代著作中的石氏星表进行校正，且拥有后者未记载"
"的十余条数据；更重要的是，其中的甘氏、巫咸星数据为学界所未见，很可能源自汉代"
"甘氏、巫咸学派。进一步的研究表明，这批数据主体观测于汉代，十分符合《三家星"
"经》中对各星官的位置描述，与唐代之前的早期星图如天象列次分野之图、敦煌星图、"
"格子月进图等也能很好对应，对早期星空复原起到了关键性作用。\n"
"\n"
"结合陈卓星表、三家星经以及早期星图，可以较为可信地复原大部分早期的星官；由于"
"星表、星图的误差以及早期文本描述的模糊性，少量星官可能还有待进一步完善。\n"
"\n"
"### 早期星官科学价值与文化涵义\n"
"\n"
"中国星座体系在现代天文学研究领域中也能发挥出独特的作用。我国古人进行了长期细"
"致的天象观测，留下了丰富的天象记录，如流星、彗星、客星、极光等，这些天象记录"
"皆以星座作为参考来记录位置。通过对早期星象的复原，能够更好地掌握当时的天象位"
"置，进而有助于古代资料在现代天文学中的应用。该星空文化中的早期紫宫已经成功运"
"用于寻找新星遗迹Z Cam的古代对应客星的研究。\n"
"\n"
"本星空文化保存了许多星官的原始面貌与位置，在此略举数例。形态方面的典型代表"
"为“华盖”“内阶”。华盖星官的形态与早期帝王出行所用部分伞盖极为相似，而后世星图"
"的华盖形态则更趋近于圆形甚至不规则形态，逐渐丧失了这种文化含义。“内阶”乃是仿"
"造“三台”（又称天阶）所造，二者为帝王往来于太微宫、文昌宫以及紫宫的路径；故早"
"期内阶的形态与三台相似，亦为阶梯状。位置方面的典型代表为“天桴”“砺石”。“天"
"桴”的本义为鼓槌，在本星空文化中与“河鼓”位置相近，该位置吻合其星占含义；而后世"
"该星官位置逐渐下移，与河鼓的联系逐渐淡化。砺石星官最初与五车相近，五车西北星"
"名为“天库”，主将军、军事，而砺石可磨砺锋刃，故位于其下，为其辅佐，欲使兵器锋"
"利、克敌制胜。宋代之后“砺石”移至“卷舌”旁边，不再符合星官创造者本意。\n"
"\n"
"三家星官的最初形态、布局是创造者所精心设计，一些星官的造型反映了其原型器物的"
"形态，一些星官之间的位置关系承载着某种星占意义的联系；而后世星官的形态位置演"
"变则失去了其创造者所赋予的原始意义。因此，本星空文化对于发掘早期星空的科学与"
"文化价值具有重要作用。"
