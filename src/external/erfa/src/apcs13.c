**  For an observer whose geocentric position and velocity are known,
**  prepare star-independent astrometry parameters for transformations
**  between ICRS and GCRS.  The Earth ephemeris is from ERFA models.
**
**  The parameters produced by this function are required in the space
**  motion, parallax, light deflection and aberration parts of the
**  astrometric transformation chain.
**
**  Given:
**     date1  double       TDB as a 2-part...
**     date2  double       ...Julian Date (Note 1)
**     pv     double[2][3] observer's geocentric pos/vel (Note 3)
**
**  Returned:
**     astrom eraASTROM*   star-independent astrometry parameters:
**      pmt    double       PM time interval (SSB, Julian years)
**      eb     double[3]    SSB to observer (vector, au)

**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TDB date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
**     others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
**     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
**     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
**     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
**     good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
**     applications of this function the choice will not be at all
**     critical.
**
**     TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
**     accuracy.
**
**  2) All the vectors are with respect to BCRS axes.
**
**  3) The observer's position and velocity pv are geocentric but with
**     respect to BCRS axes, and in units of m and m/s.  No assumptions
**     are made about proximity to the Earth, and the function can be
**     used for deep space applications as well as Earth orbit and
**     terrestrial.
**
**  4) In cases where the caller wishes to supply his own Earth
**     ephemeris, the function eraApcs can be used instead of the present
**     function.
**
**  5) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
**     structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
**     astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.
**
**     The various functions support different classes of observer and
**     portions of the transformation chain:
**
**          functions         observer        transformation
**
**       eraApcg eraApcg13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS
**       eraApci eraApci13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> CIRS
**       eraApco eraApco13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> observed
**       eraApcs eraApcs13    space           ICRS <-> GCRS
**       eraAper eraAper13    terrestrial     update Earth rotation
**       eraApio eraApio13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
**
**     Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary ERFA models to
**     compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
**     supplied by the caller.
**
**     The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
**     parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
**     comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
**     observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
**     aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
**     transformation), and atmospheric refraction.
**
**  6) The context structure astrom produced by this function is used by
**     eraAtciq* and eraAticq*.
