<h2>Tibetan Lunar Mansions (Preliminary)</h2>

<p><em>This is unfinished work and only a tentative solution. Please help us improve! (see below)</em></p>

<p>During a travel to the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China (TAR) in 2019, 
I was confronted with a highly complex system of astronomy and calendar computations which has a long tradition in Tibet.
However, not much is known of the Tibetan Lunar Stations outside of Tibet. 
Most literature is Tibetan or Chinese only, and there were no Tibetan star maps available. Also our guides could not explain any of the following to us.<p>

The Men Tsee Khang Institute for Astro and Medicine in Lhasa, TAR, is the central authority for traditional Tibetan medicine and astrology, 
two fields of research which are closely related in Tibetan tradition. The institute is in charge of editing the annual Tibetan calendar. 
Although this can be described algorithmically, Men Tsee Khang experts have re-erected a calendar observatory in Stag Phu monastery, 
where a sunrise observation is performed on each March 17th for calibrating the calendar. 
On this day, just as the sun climbs over a mountain ridge, its first rays are cast through a window in the observatory tower onto a particular rock which has been embedded into a circular platform. </p>

<p>The Men Tsee Khang emblem shows 27 stick figures for the Lunar mansions arranged in a circle around the central figure. 
The same figures are also laid out in cement with bright stones connected by black lines in the circular platform which has been erected when the observatory was rebuilt in 2009. 
These 27 <em>gyukar</em> figures are described as being equal to the Indian <em>Nakṣatras</em> and represent sections of 13°20' longitude along the ecliptic. 
Actually, one of the <em>gyukars</em> consists of 2 constellations, therefore 28 <em>lunar constellations</em> are named.</p>

<p>The Lunar Mansions in this skyculture are shown as asterisms among the traditional 12 Ptolemaic zodiacal constellations, which are also known in Tibet. 
It is assumed that most originate from the Indian traditions, esp. Kalacakra, 
but it appears that some Chinese influence is also present, e.g. Nr. 11. 
Only for the Zodiacal constellations artwork is provided.
A few more constellations in Ptolemaic tradition are displayed in the northern sky to allow easier orientation, but with their names suppressed. 
We have no information about their names or relevance of these in Tibet.

<p>The following table was taken from Cornu. Note that Tibetans start counting at zero, while the Indians count from 1. </p>

<h3>Please help us</h3>
<p>The figures are my own attempt of identification. 
We can be sure about the placement of only a few which can also be found in other sky cultures, e.g. Japanese Moon Stations.
Others appear to have been taken over from Chinese tradition, e.g. Nr. 11. 
For others, I am very unsure. 
Many stars are rather dim, and the figures in the emblem apparently have to be rotated in arbitrary ways, like Gyukar 3=Hyades. 
Others require large liberties to accept a topological match. 
Alternative matches with stars in similar topology arranged in the orientation shown in the emblem (north=outer circle) 
have been found only in neighboring areas of the sky, making a match rather unlikely. 
We would like to hear from experts of Tibetan astronomy about better or even confirmed identification.
