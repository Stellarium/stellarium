<h2>Inuit</h2>
<p>The Inuit sky culture files available for Stellarium are an adaptation of John MacDonald's research in his book <b>The Arctic Sky: Inuit Astronomy, Star Lore and Legend</b>. While placements and specifics of Inuit constellations might differ from tribe to tribe, the information in Stellarium presents the constellations and general themes of the arctic universe.</p>
