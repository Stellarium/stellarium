  /** @name Introduction

      This library provides a core set of functions for programming
      FLI CCD cameras, filter wheels, and focusers under Windows and
      Linux.  The type definitions, function prototypes, and
      definitions/enumerations of constant values used by library
      functions are spcified in \texttt{libfli.h}.  All library
      functions return zero on sucessful completion, and non-zero if
      an error occurred.  The exact nature of an error can be found by
      treating the negative of a function's return value as a system
      error code, for example:

      \begin{verbatim}
      if ((err = FLIOpen(&dev, name, domain)))
      {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error FLIOpen: %s\n", strerror((int)-err));
        exit(1);
      }
      \end{verbatim}
