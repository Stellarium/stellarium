# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
#
# $ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
#
# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
#
# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
# and then we would define $MISSING as
#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
#
# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a
# configured tree to be moved without reconfiguration.

# Rely on autoconf to set up CDPATH properly.

dnl License but which still want to provide support for the GNU gettext
dnl functionality.

dnl by the GNU Library General Public License, and the rest of the GNU
dnl gettext package package is covered by the GNU General Public License.

dnl Macro to add for using GNU gettext.

dnl Usage: AM_GNU_GETTEXT([INTLSYMBOL], [NEEDSYMBOL], [INTLDIR]).
dnl INTLSYMBOL can be one of 'external', 'no-libtool', 'use-libtool'. The
dnl    default (if it is not specified or empty) is 'no-libtool'.
dnl    INTLSYMBOL should be 'external' for packages with no intl directory,
dnl    and 'no-libtool' or 'use-libtool' for packages with an intl directory.
dnl    If INTLSYMBOL is 'use-libtool', then a libtool library
dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.la will be created (shared and/or static,
dnl    depending on --{enable,disable}-{shared,static} and on the presence of
dnl    AM-DISABLE-SHARED). If INTLSYMBOL is 'no-libtool', a static library
dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.a will be created.
dnl If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is 'need-ngettext', then GNU gettext
dnl    implementations (in libc or libintl) without the ngettext() function
dnl    will be ignored.  If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is
dnl    'need-formatstring-macros', then GNU gettext implementations that don't
dnl    support the ISO C 99 <inttypes.h> formatstring macros will be ignored.
dnl INTLDIR is used to find the intl libraries.  If empty,
dnl    the value `$(top_builddir)/intl/' is used.
dnl
dnl The result of the configuration is one of three cases:
dnl 1) GNU gettext, as included in the intl subdirectory, will be compiled
dnl    and used.
dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
dnl 2) GNU gettext has been found in the system's C library.
dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
dnl 3) No internationalization, always use English msgid.
dnl    Catalog format: none
dnl    Catalog extension: none
dnl If INTLSYMBOL is 'external', only cases 2 and 3 can occur.
dnl The use of .gmo is historical (it was needed to avoid overwriting the
dnl GNU format catalogs when building on a platform with an X/Open gettext),
dnl but we keep it in order not to force irrelevant filename changes on the
dnl maintainers.

  dnl Sometimes libintl requires libiconv, so first search for libiconv.
  dnl Ideally we would do this search only after the
  dnl      if test "$USE_NLS" = "yes"; then
  dnl        if test "$gt_cv_func_gnugettext_libc" != "yes"; then
  dnl tests. But if configure.in invokes AM_ICONV after AM_GNU_GETTEXT
  dnl the configure script would need to contain the same shell code
  dnl again, outside any 'if'. There are two solutions:
  dnl - Invoke AM_ICONV_LINKFLAGS_BODY here, outside any 'if'.
  dnl - Control the expansions in more detail using AC_PROVIDE_IFELSE.
