<h2>Indian Vedic</h2>
<p>Vedic Culture with some commonly known constellations related to Nakshatra.</p>

<h3>Rāśi - Asterisms</h3>
<p>The sidereal zodiac is an imaginary belt of 360 degrees (like the tropical zodiac), divided into 12 equal parts. Each twelfth part (of 30 degrees) is called a sign or rashi. Their names are shown in (brackets).</p>
<p>In vedic astronomy there are two system of measuring time - Lunar Calender & Solar calender. In both cases one year is devided into 12 months or "māsā". Name of the solar months originated from these constellation' names.</p>

<h3>Nakṣatra - constellation</h3>
<p>These are marked positions of the Moon during the Lunar month and traditional bhartiya astronomy, based on a list of 28 (sometimes 27) Asterisms found in the Atharvaveda and also in the Shatapatha Brahmana. </p>
<p>In mythology the Nakshatras are considered to be the 27 daughters of Daksha Prajipati and wives of Chandra, the god of moon. Daksha found that Soma overly favored one daughter (rohinī) over the others, thus neglecting their needs and flouting his responsibilities. For this, Daksha cursed him to wither and die. Chandra Dev approached and worshipped Lord Shiva in order to be relieved of the curse. He gave Chandra the boon that in a lunar month, he would grow for fifteen days (or "Pakshā") in one half and in the other half he would keep losing one shade (or "Kalā") per lunar day (or "tithi") and decrease in size.</p>
<p>Name of the lunar months originated from those 12 Asterisms' names in which full moon or "Purnimā" occurs. Unlike a solar day which defined by a sunrise to next sunrise, a lunar day or moon's position in a nakshatra doesn't depends on sun rising or moon rising. Thus a lunar day may start in any time of a solar day. Like other ancient human cultures, vedic people innovated a number of systems of which intercalary lunar months became most used, that is adding another month every 32.5 months on average or 4 months in every 11 years to correct the mismatch between lunar and solar year.</p>

<h3>Navagraha - Nine planets</h3>
<p>They observed that some celestial body moves independently relative to background stars and named them planets or "graha". As such The sun and moon are also treated as graha or planet. They also named the lunar nodes as planets as these points are very inportant to calculate the eclipses. Name of vedic days originated from these planet's names.</p>
