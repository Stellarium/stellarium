\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:plugin:Calendars:Introduction}

The calendar dates in the main program behave like most other astronomical software titles:

\begin{itemize}
\item Dates are given in the Gregorian calendar for all dates
  beginning with October 15, 1582.
\item All earlier dates are given in the Julian Calendar in its
  finalized form by \name{Augustus}. Historically, only dates
  beginning with March 1st, 4 A.D. coincide with historically recorded
  dates: the Roman priesthood messed up the 4-year count introduced by
  \name[Julius]{Caesar} and counted leap years every third
  year. \name{Augustus} decreed to omit leap days from 12~B.C. to
  4~A.D. to move the seasons to where \name[Julius]{Caesar} had placed
  them.
\item Given the errors in the Julian calendar, simulation in early
  prehistory will provide non-intuitive calendar dates for the
  seasons' beginnings.
\item Astronomical counting of years includes a year zero and negative
  years. Historical calendars don't have a year zero. 1~A.D. is
  preceded by 1~B.C. Therefore a negative year in Stellarium may look
  uncommon to historians who may think Stellarium is one year off.
\end{itemize}


Since earliest times people all over the world have observed the sky
and used its phenomena to record and measure time. Over millennia,
various systematic calendars evolved. A classic and often-cited
presentation of calendars from the pre-computer era is still the
monumental work by Ginzel (\citeyear{Ginzel:ChronologieI, Ginzel:ChronologieII,
  Ginzel:ChronologieIII}).  The next challenge was then to describe the
systematic of these algorithmically and make them available for
computer programs.  \citet{Reingold-Dershowitz:2018} have presented a
modern masterpiece of this kind and are our preferred source of
algorithms. This plugin \newFeature{v0.20.4} will evolve over the next
time to bring a good sample of calendars into Stellarium.

In the configuration panel you can select which calendars you want to
display in the lower right corner of the sceen, and can also directly
interact with some of them.


The calendars displayed in this plugin come with their own
logic. Historically, when a calendar was introduced, dates which
precede its starting point (era) were of little interest to its users,
therefore if a date bears negative years (or negative units of its
largest component) those dates may not be useful.

Note that in some calendars the day did not begin at midnight, but for
example at sunrise, sunset, or dawn. This cannot be reflected in this
plugin. Dates should be correct at noon, and may be one day off
dependent on these aspects.

\subsection{Lunisolar European calendars}
\begin{description}
\item[Julian] This implementation utilizes historical year counting,
  i.e., has no year zero. Years are marked A.D. or B.C., respectively.
\item[Gregorian] This implementation acts like Stellarium with respect
  to year counting and counts negative and positive years, with a year
  zero between them. It shows dates in a \emph{Proleptic Gregorian}
  calendar for dates before October 15, 1582. Given its improved rules
  for leap years, it keep the seasons's beginnings closer to the
  commonly known dates, at least for many more centuries in the past
  than the Julian calendar commonly used by historians.
\item[ISO Week] The International Standards Organisation describes
  weeks in the Gregorian calendar from Monday (Day 1) to Sunday (Day
  7). Week 1 of each year contains the first Thursday of the
  year. Years may have a week 53, where the last days already belong
  to the next Gregorian year.
\item[Icelandic calendar] Since 1700, this counts weeks in summer and
  winter seasons, 12 months of 30 days with a few extra days and the
  occasional leap week after the third month of summer. Year numbers
  concur with the Gregorian, but start with summer in late April.
\item[Roman calendar] This presents the Roman way of writing calendar
  dates in the Julian calendar and provides dates \emph{ab urbe condita} (A.U.C.).
\item[Olympic calendar] Another way to write the years in the Julian
  calendar uses the Greek Olympiads, a 4-year cycle starting in 776
  B.C.E. The Olympic games of antiquity were held in year 1 of each cycle.
\end{description}

\subsection{Near Eastern calendars}
Several calendars with 12 months of 30 days plus 5 (6 for leap years
in some calendars) \emph{epagomenae} days, with different \emph{calendar eras}.
\begin{description}
\item[Egyptian] A 365 day year without leap days. Following the
  tradition of \name{Ptolemy}, we use the \emph{era of Nabonassar}.
\item[Armenian] also has no leap days.
\item[Zoroastrian] also has no leap days. This uses different names
  for each day of the month and for each \emph{epagomenae} day. Month
  names are from \citet[\S69]{Ginzel:ChronologieI} with
  transliteration adapted to \citet{Reingold-Dershowitz:2018}.
\item[Coptic] Month names derived from the Egyptian calendar, but with
  leap year every 4th year. Its \emph{era martyrum} is also called
  \emph{Diocletian era}.
\item[Ethiopic] Parallel to the Coptic calendar, just with different
  year number, the \emph{ethiopic era of mercy}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Mesoamerican calendars}
\begin{description}
\item[Maya Long Count] is a 5-part sequence of numbers. Just like most
  modern people write numbers in the decimal system (base 10), the
  Maya used base 20 as their unit. However, this count uses a
  mixed-base system. The lowest (rightmost) number (\emph{kin}) runs
  from 0 to 19, the second-lowest (\emph{uinal}) from 0 to 17, the
  others from 0 to 19 again. It is assumed these lowest places of
  $20\times18=360$ days have been used to approximate the solar year,
  so that the third number from the right (\emph{tun}) increases about
  once per year. The higher places are called \emph{katun} and
  \emph{baktun}. Most scientists agree that the zero point of the long
  count corresponds to Monday, September 6, 3114 B.C. (Julian), but in
  many sources dates in the proleptic Gregorian calendar are listed,
  where this date is given as August 11, -3113. This plugin finally
  allows the use of both systems.

  In December of 2012 some people were afraid that the switchover from
  \emph{baktun} 12 to 13 (something which accurs about every 400
  years) would cause armageddon, just as other people prefer to be
  afraid of turns of centuries or millennia of the Christian year
  count.
\item[Maya Haab] is a calendar of 18 ``months'' of 20 days each
  (counted 1 to 20), plus 5 days (\emph{Uayeb}) at the end, providing
  ``years'' of 365 days.
\item[Maya Tzolkin] is described as ritual calendar consisting of two
  cycles with 13 day numbers (1 to 13) and 20 names. Each day both
  counters are advanced. Date names repeat after 260 days. Usually
  Haab and Tzolkin calendars were both used to define a unique date
  which repeats only after a \emph{calendar round} of 52 years.
\item[Aztec Xihuitl] is similar to the Maya Haab, consisting of 18
  ``months'' of 20 days, plus 5 \emph{nemontemi} (worthless
  days). Days are counted from 1 to 20. The Aztecs may have used
  intercalation, but details have been lost. The correlation in use
  here is based on the recorded Aztec date of the fall of their empire
  to \name[Hern\'an]{Cort\'es} in 1521 and should provide correct dates in the
  early 16th century.
\item[Aztec Tonalpohualli] is similar in structure to the Mayan Tzolkin.
\end{description}

\subsection{Further development}
The plugin is in an early phase of development. More calendars will be added in later versions. 


\subsection{Configuration Options}
\label{sec:plugin:Calendars:configuration}

The configuration dialog allows the selection of the calendars which are
of interest to you, and also provides direct interaction with the calendars.
The Mayan and Aztec calendars allow moving to the previous or next date of that respective name. 

\subsection*{Section \big[Calendars\big] in config.ini file}

Apart from changing settings using the plugin configuration dialog,
you can also edit the \file{config.ini} file to change
settings for the Calendars plugin -- just make it carefully!
