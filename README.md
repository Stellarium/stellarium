## About

Stellarium is a free GPL software which renders realistic skies in real time
with OpenGL. It is available for Linux/Unix, Windows and MacOSX. With
Stellarium, you really see what you can see with your eyes, binoculars or a
small telescope.

## Installation 

Please see the [INSTALL](install.md) file.

## Requirements

Windows or linux/POSIX or CYGWIN or MACOSX environment
A 3d OpenGL 2.1+ acceleration card with GLSL1.30 and a good CPU.
On Windows, ANGLE can be used if graphics card supports DirectX9+ with PS_3_0.
If all else fails, MESA can be used to emulate the graphics card, 
of course with a massive slowdown.

## Quick Start

Navigation :
Use the direction keys or drag with the mouse to move the point of view.
Use page up and page down keys or mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
Use left mouse button to select an object, right button to select no object and
middle mouse button or SPACE to center on the selected object.
Zooming on nebulas or planets is very interesting....
Use J, K and L to increment/decrement time speed.
Press the F1 key for more help.

More help can be found on www.stellarium.org, and in the user guide.

## Configuration

From version 0.6.0 the most useful configuration options can be set from within
the program.
You can however change it by hand in the file config.ini in the user data
directory.  See http://www.stellarium.org/doc/head/fileStructure.html
for more details on the location of the user data directory for your OS.
