**  Time scale transformation:  Geocentric Coordinate Time, TCG, to
**  Terrestrial Time, TT.
**
**  Given:
**     tcg1,tcg2  double    TCG as a 2-part Julian Date
**
**  Returned:
**     tt1,tt2    double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                int       status:  0 = OK
**
**  Note:
**
**     tcg1+tcg2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way
**     between the two arguments, for example where tcg1 is the Julian
**     Day Number and tcg22 is the fraction of a day.  The returned
**     tt1,tt2 follow suit.
