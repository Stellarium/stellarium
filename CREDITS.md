	3.7 Naval Observatory Merged Astrometric Dataset (NOMAD) version 1
	    http://www.nofs.navy.mil/nomad
	    Norbert Zacharias writes:
	    "There are no fees, both UCAC and NOMAD are freely available
	    with the only requirement that the source of the data (U.S.
	    Naval Observatory) and original product name need to be provided
	    with any distribution, as well as a description about any
	    changes made to the data, if at all."
	    The changes made to the data are:
	    -) try to compute visual magnitude and color from the b,v,r
	       values
	    -) compute nr_of_measurements = the number of valid b,v,r values
	    -) throw away or keep stars (depending on magnitude,
	       nr_of_measurements, combination of flags, tycho2 number)
	    -) add all stars from Hipparcos (incl. component solutions), and
	       tycho2+1st supplement
	    -) reorganize the stars in several brigthness levels and
	       triangular zones according to position and magnitude
	    The programs that are used to generate the star files are called
	    "MakeCombinedCatalogue", "ParseHip", "ParseNomad", and can be
	    found in the util subdirectory in source code. The position,
	    magnitudes, and proper motions of the stars coming from NOMAD
	    are unchanged, except for a possible loss of precision,
	    especially in magnitude. When there is no v-magnitude, it is
	    estimated from r or b magnitude.  When there is no b- or v-
	    magnitude, the color B-V is estimated from the other magnitudes.
	    Also proper motions of faint stars are neglected at all.
