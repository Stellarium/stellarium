"The Book of Fixed Stars was written shortly before 964 AD. Dr. Paul "
"Kunitzsch described it as \"the most outstanding among the works of the "
"prominent astronomer Abu 'l-Ḥusayn 'Abd al-Raḥmān ibn 'Umar al-Şūfi (born in"
" Rayy, 903; died 986), referred to as al-Sufi. In it, al-Şūfī treats the 48 "
"classical constellations, which were established and transmitted in "
"Ptolemy's Almagest. The description of each constellation comprises the "
"following four sections: first, a general discussion of the constellation "
"and its individual stars; this section also includes alŞūfi's criticism of "
"the Ptolemaic tradition and notices of his own observations. Second, a "
"record of the indigenous Arabic star names falling under that constellation,"
" and the exact identification of the respective stars with the corresponding"
" Ptolemaic stars. Third, two drawings of the constellation, one as it is "
"seen on a celestial globe, and the other one as it is seen in the sky. "
"Fourth, a table of the stars making up that constellation, giving a verbal "
"description of each star's location and its longitude, latitude, and "
"magnitude. This table closely follows the arrangement of Ptolemy's star "
"catalogue in the Almagest.\" <sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">[1]</a></sup>. In "
"addition to the four sections of each constellation mentioned by dr. "
"Kunitzsch, Al-Sufi would identify stars within the 6 magnitudes that were "
"neglected by Ptolemy, but he did not catalogue them and was faithful to "
"Ptolemy star catalog."

"An important aspect of the general discussion section is Al-Sufi method of "
"facilitating the star identification. He describes each individual star in "
"more than way: By the star position related to the constellation figure, by "
"its magnitude, by the asterism it forms with other stars like triangle or "
"arc shapes, sometimes by the star position related to the Milky way, and by "
"the angular distance from a close by star. I have counted more than 700 "
"angular distances measured by al-Sufi in his book. The units he uses for "
"angular distances are cubits, spear length, man-height, span, and finger. "
"Al-Sufi explicitly said in his book that a cubit is equal to two degrees and"
" 20 minutes <sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\">[2]</a></sup>. For the other units,"
" Schjellerup concluded some values, but tracking the 700 measurements, I "
"came up with different values. The following table summarizes the units and "
"relationship to the cubit value from Schjellerup<sup><a "
"href=\"#footnote-3\">[3]</a></sup> and from my research."

"One hundred and forty years ago, a Boorong family at Lake Tyrrell (North-"
"Western Victoria, Australia) told William Stanbridge something of their "
"stories relating to the night sky.  Some forty stars, constellations and "
"other celestial phenomena were named and located. He wrote them down and "
"related this information to the Philosophical Institute in Melbourne in "
"1857. In his paper he wrote down the Aboriginal term and gave its European "
"equivalent.  What John Morieson has done is look closely at these celestial "
"phenomena, attempt to satisfactorily identity them and to imitate the way "
"the Boorong people may have seen them. John's interpretation was used to "
"create the constellation figures in Stellarium."

"manioc (<em>Manihot esculenta</em>), who also practice fishing, hunting, and"
" gathering of wild plant. However, as one of the first indigenous groups "
"that was encountered by the Europeans at the time of conquest, the Lokono "
"have been in contact with non-indigenous populations for over 500 "
"years.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\">[2]</a></sup> This contact has "
"intensified in the last century, leading to a substantial loss of the Lokono"
" language, traditional material and immaterial culture, changes in "
"subsistence practices, and in particular to the disappearance of <em"
">medicine-men</em>&mdash;the traditional carriers of spiritual knowledge, "
"most likely including ethnoastronomical knowledge. As a consequence, the "
"modern knowledge about celestial bodies appears to be but a fraction of what"
" the Lokono knew about stars in the past. Several constellations mentioned "

"The constellation <em>Mabukuli</em> &lsquo;Man without a thigh&rsquo; is "
"well known among the Lokono and appears in a few myths. According to Charles"
" Dance, an unsuccessful huntsman cut off his own leg, wrapped it up in a "
"leaf, and gave to his step mother so that she had something to eat, and "
"ascended to sky.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-16\">[16]</a></sup> Similarly, the "
"Penard brothers speak of an unsuccessful hunter who cut off his leg and gave"
" it to his wife and mother-in-law, telling them it was tapir meat.<sup><a "
"href=\"#footnote-17\">[17]</a></sup> He then asked other people to follow "
"his traces to help him bring the rest of the tapir, but when they arrived at"
" the place they only found the <em>akalali</em> plant with which he treated "
"his wounds. His body turned into the <em>Kama t&acirc;la</em> constellation "
"and his spirit into <em>Mabukuli</em>. Claudius de Goeje relates a "
"strikingly different myth.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-11\">[11]</a></sup> The "
"Sun, once a man called <em>Arawidi </em>(see the myth about <em>Hadali</em> "
"'Sun'), took a woman as his wife, who followed him with unborn twins inside "
"her. One day, she lost the way and ended up being eaten by vulture spirits, "
"but her twins were brought up by an old woman, whom they later killed and "
"ran away. While hiding in a treetop, they saw a woman catching fish with a "
"sifter. She saw their reflection in the water and tried to catch it, at "
"which they laughed. She then realized they were up in the tree, and sent "
"ants up the tree to make them come down. When they came down, she killed one"
" of them and took the other home. One of her daughters fell in love with the"
" man and married him. Now the husband had to catch a lot of fish every day "
"for the mother-in-law. One day, tired of his demanding mother-in-law, he "
"tricked her into getting into the water to help him unload a boat full of "
"fish, where she was eaten by a shark. When her other daughter arrived, the "
"liver of her mother was still floating on the water and told her that the "
"man killed her. The daughter wanted to kill him but he flew away on wings of"
" cotton that his wife made for him, so she only cut his thigh off, which is "
"why he is now the constellation <em>Mabukuli</em>. It appears the Orion's "
"belt represents the cut-off leg, not the man himself."

"La constelación de <em>Mabukuli</em> \"Hombre sin muslo\" es bien conocida "
"entre los Lokono y aparece en algunos mitos. Según Charles Dance, un cazador"
" fracasado se cortó la pierna, la envolvió en una hoja y se la dio a su "
"madrastra para que comiera algo, y ascendió al cielo. <sup><a "
"href=\"#footnote-16\">[16]</a></sup> Del mismo modo, los hermanos Penard "
"hablan de un cazador fracasado que le cortó la pierna y se lo dio a su "
"esposa y suegra, diciéndoles que era carne de tapir. <sup><a "
"href=\"#footnote-17\">[17]</a></sup> Luego pidió a otras personas que "
"siguieran sus huellas para ayudarlo a traer el resto del tapir, pero cuando "
"llegaron al lugar solo encontraron la planta <em>akalali</em> con la que "
"trató sus heridas. Su cuerpo se convirtió en la constelación de <em>Kama "
"tâla</em> y su espíritu en <em>Mabukuli</em>. Claudio de Goeje relata un "

"href=\"#footnote-11\">[11]</a></sup> The Sun, una vez que un hombre llamado "
"<em>Arawidi</em> (ver el mito sobre <em>Hadali</em> 'Sun'), tomó a una mujer"

"día, perdió el camino y terminó siendo devorada por espíritus buitres, pero "
"sus gemelos fueron criados por una anciana, a quien luego mataron y huyeron."
" Mientras se escondían en la copa de un árbol, vieron a una mujer pescar con"
" un tamiz. Ella vio su reflejo en el agua e intentó atraparlo, de lo que se "
"rieron. Luego se dio cuenta de que estaban en el árbol y envió hormigas para"
" que bajaran. Cuando bajaron, ella mató a uno de ellos y se llevó el otro a "
"casa. Una de sus hijas se enamoró del hombre y se casó con él. Ahora el "
"marido tenía que pescar muchos peces todos los días para la suegra. Un día, "
"cansado de su exigente suegra, la engañó para que se metiera en el agua para"
" ayudarlo a descargar un bote lleno de peces, donde un tiburón la comió. "
"Cuando llegó su otra hija, el hígado de su madre todavía flotaba en el agua "
"y le dijo que el hombre la mató. La hija quería matarlo, pero él se fue "
"volando con alas de algodón que su esposa hizo para él, por lo que solo le "
"cortó el muslo, por lo que ahora él es la constelación de <em>Mabukuli</em>."
" Parece que el cinturón de Orión representa la pierna cortada, no el hombre "
"mismo."

"Maya culture was one of the most sophisticated civilizations in the pre-"
"columbian american continent. They developed a writing system which let them"
" store and use their knowledge in a variety of forms: e.g. on how to perform"
" rituals or delivering particular messages to an audience (political and "
"sacred facts from rulers to the people, sculpted in monuments and stelae). "
"These records allow us explore, through the laborious work of many "
"researchers, their cosmovision and how they thought the cosmos came to be. "
"Their knowledge was recorded in books (academically known as “codex”), like "
"the Dresden codex (which describes the dates that Venus would pass through "
"each of its visibility phases and also a table of lunar and solar eclipses),"
" the Paris codex (which is believed to describe some of their "
"constellations), the Madrid codex (which relates astronomy and agriculture "
"data) and lately, the Grolier codex (it was thought that it was an "
"abbreviated version of the Dresden codex, but it is not accepted yet as "
"original by some scholars)."

"The zodiac definitely came to Greece from Babylonian source.  It is not "

"divided into 12x30 units, equaling our 360°. These direct citations from the"
" 4th century BCE suggest a much earlier invention because the concept of the"
" zodiac of 360° was very likely well established in Babylonian mathematical "
"astronomy before it was copied by Greek mathematicians.  Taking Eudoxus' "
"writing as a <em>terminus ante quem</em>, we extrapolate a date for the "
"genesis of the zodiac in Mesopotamia before 400 BCE.  In other fragments of "
"mathematical astronomy (between 800 and 700 BCE) the concept of the zodiac "
"is not present.  Some scholars argue for the 6th century BCE as date of "
"invention - but to be honest, we don't know.  The common sense is that the "

"The names of the planets displayed in Stellarium are names of the objects in"

"Whilst the most-notable/common stars and constellations (i.e. Orion, "
"Pleiades, Crux) are identified in Tongan star lore there are two notable "
"exceptions. There is an absence of naming of the North star (Polaris: "
"&alpha; UMi). This is peculiar considering the latitude of the Tongan "
"islands and the prominence of this star at certain times of the year. In the"
" event of any northerly journeys from Tonga such an important navigational "
"landmark could not have possibly gone unnoticed. The constellation of "
"Scorpio (parts in, or stars of) are also absent from Tongan star lore. This "
"is surprising since the vast majority of star lore &ndash; globally and "
