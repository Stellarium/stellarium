     Instructions on using CFITSIO on Windows platforms for C programmers

These instructions use a simple DOS-style command window. It is also possible
to build and use CFITSIO within a GUI programming environment such as Visual
Studio, but this is not supported here.

===============================================================================
1.  Build the CFITSIO dll library  

This step will create the cfitsio.def, cfitsio.dll, and cfitsio.lib files.
(If you downloaded the CFITSIO .zip file that contains the pre-built binary
.dll file, then SKIP THIS STEP).

  A. With Microsoft Visual C++:

      1. Open a DOS command window and execute the vcvars32.bat file that 
         is distributed with older versions of Visual C++, or simply open 
         the Visual C++ command window (e.g., when using Visual Studio 2010).

      2. Unpack the CFITSIO source files (cfitxxxx.zip) into a new empty directory

      3. In the DOS command window, cd to that directory and enter the 
         following commands:

		nmake winDumpExts.mak
		nmake makefile.vcc
			(ignore the compiler warning messages)

  B: With  Borland C++:

     First, follow the instructions provided by Borland to set up
     the proper environment variables and configure files for the compiler.
   
     Unpack the cfitsio.zip source file distribution into a suitable directory.
   
     In a DOS command window, cd to that directory and then execute the 
     makepc.bat batch file on the command line to build the CFITSIO library, 
     and the testprog and cookbook sample programs.

===============================================================================
2.  Test the CFITSIO library with Visual C++

     Compile and link the testprog.c test program.  When using Visual Studio,
     the command is:

		cl /MD testprog.c cfitsio.lib


     This will create the testprog.exe executable program.  Running this
     program should print out a long series of diagnostic messages
     that should end with "Status = 0; OK - no error"

===============================================================================
3.  Compile and link an application program that calls CFITSIO routines
    with Visual C++

	Include the fitsio.h and longnam.h header files in the C source code.

	Link the program with the cfitsio.lib file:

		cl /MD your_program.c cfitsio.lib


	NOTE: The /MD command line switch must be specified on the cl
	command line to force the compiler/linker to use the
	appropriete runtime library.   If this switch is omitted, then
	the fits_report_error function in CFITSIO will likely crash.  

	When building programs in the Visual Studio environment, one
	can force the equivalent of the /MD switch by selecting
	'Settings...' under the 'Project' menu, then click on the C/C++
	tab and select the 'Code Generator' category.  Then under 'User
	Run-time Library' select 'Multithreaded DLL'.
