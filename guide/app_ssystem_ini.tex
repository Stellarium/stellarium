\section{Solar System Configuration Files}
\label{sec:ssystem.ini}

The files\footnote{Before v0.16, there was a single file, \file{ssystem.ini}, with slightly different rules.}
 \file{ssystem\_major.ini} and  \file{ssystem\_minor.ini}  
(in the \file{data/} subdirectory of the program directory, 
contain orbital and rotational data from which Stellarium configures the Solar
System objects. 

The minor bodies can be modified by placing a privately modified 
copy of \file{ssystem\_minor.ini} into your own
\file{data/} directory (see Chapter~\ref{sec:FilesAndDirectories}). 
You can edit the file either manually or with the Solar System Editor plugin (see
Section~\ref{sec:plugins:SolarSystemEditor}). The private user file is automatically created by the Solar System Editor plugin.


%Deprecated parameters are marked by gray background. 
%Possible new parameters are marked by yellow background.
%% GZ This is no longer true. Reactivate somehow? 

Each object's data are described in its own section which is typically
named after the object name. Some section names (e.g.\ those using
diacriticals, spaces or other problematic characters) appear a bit mangled.

We list here examples for the major planets, larger moons with special
coordinate functions, minor moons with generic orbital elements, minor
planets and comets with elliptical and parabolic orbit elements.

All elements are stored in alphabetic order in the files, however it
makes more sense to present the elements in another sequence which
better reflects the meaning. The actual order of the objects in the
files, and order of entries inside an object section, is irrelevant,
but in case of duplicate entries the later entry is used.

rot_pole_w0=284.95
rot_pole_w1=870.5360000

\end{configfile}


where 
\begin{description}
\item[name] English name of the planet. May appear translated. 
\item[type] Mandatory for planets: \value{planet}
\item[parent]=Sun. The body which this object is running around. Default: \texttt{Sun}
\item[coord\_func] The planet positions are all computed with a dedicated function (VSOP87 or DE43x). 
\item[orbit\_visualization\_period] number of (earth) days for how
  long the orbit should be made visible. Typically Stellarium shows
  one orbit line. The orbit slowly drifts, however.

\item[atmosphere] (0 or 1) flag to indicate whether observer locations should enable atmosphere drawing.

\item[radius] Equator radius, km.
\item[oblateness] Flattening of the polar diameter. ($1-r_{pole}/r_{eq}$)
\item[albedo] total albedo (reflectivity) of the planet. Used for ``generic''
  magnitude computation, but the major planets usually have dedicated
  magnitude formulas, so the value is not evaluated unless you are
  observing from a location outside Earth.
\item[color] Used to colorize halo. At least one of the components should be 1.
\item[tex\_map] File name of texture map in \file{textures} folder.
\item[halo] Should be true to draw a halo (simple light disk) when object too small to draw a sphere. Default: \texttt{true}
\end{description}

\paragraph{Elements for the Physical Ephemeris}

Where known, Stellarium can properly model axis rotation with the
\texttt{rot\_\ldots} entries in the element sets.  Versions prior to
0.21 had rotational elements defined with respect to the equator of
the parent object. While writing this documentation the origin and
accuracy of this model is unfortunately untraceable.  However, the IAU
Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements
(WGCCRE) and modern sources like \citet{ESAA:2013} use rotational
elements with respect to the ICRF (see section
\ref{sec:Concepts:Equatorial}). Therefore, starting with version 0.21,\newFeature{v.0.21}
Stellarium uses these more modern data and can now also show axes with
precessional or other motions. Data for some planet moons are
unfortunately still not available in this WGCCRE format, and therefore
the old format can still be used, but should not be used for new
entries.

\begin{description}
\item[rot\_equator\_ascending\_node] \emph{deprecated}
\item[rot\_obliquity] \emph{deprecated}
\item[rot\_rotation\_offset] \emph{deprecated} longitude of prime
  meridian. For Planets, this used to be counted from the ascending
  node of the equator over the ecliptical plane at J2000.0. For moons,
  it is the longitude of the prime meridian counted from the ascending
  node of the moon's equator over the planet equator.  A special value
  here indicates special treatment for the Great Red Spot.
\item[rot\_periode] \emph{deprecated} Duration of one sidereal rotation, in earth hours.

\item[rot\_pole\_ra]  constant of axis right ascension in ICRF, degrees
\item[rot\_pole\_ra1] change per century of axis right ascension in ICRF, degrees
\item[rot\_pole\_de] constant of axis declination in ICRF, degrees
\item[rot\_pole\_de1] change per century of axis declination in ICRF, degrees
\item[rot\_pole\_w0] longitude of the prime meridian counted from the
  ascending node of the objects's equator through the ICRF equator, degrees
\item[rot\_pole\_w1] change per day of axis rotation, degrees
\end{description}

\noindent In many cases, the attitude/rotation formulae for the North (or
``positive'') pole $(\alpha_0, \delta_0)$ are given like
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:PlanetOrientation}
  \alpha_0 &=& \mathtt{rot\_pole\_ra} + T * \mathtt{rot\_pole\_ra1}\\
  \delta_0 &=& \mathtt{rot\_pole\_de} + T * \mathtt{rot\_pole\_de1}\\
  W        &=& \mathtt{rot\_pole\_w0} + d * \mathtt{rot\_pole\_w1}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent These cases are fully covered by the data in
\file{ssystem\_major.ini}. Corrections for solar system objects given
by \citet{ESAA:2013, WGCCRE2009, WGCCRE2009:corr, WGCCRE2015,
  WGCCRE2015:corr} have been implemented in the program.


\subsubsection{Moon section}
\label{sec:ssystem.ini:Moon}

All planet moons are defined only in \file{ssystem\_major.ini}.

Moons are special in that they orbit another planet. Therefore, the
rotational elements used to be specified relative to the equatorial
plane of the parent planet, and \texttt{orbit\_SemiMajorAxis} are
specified in kilometers.  However, \newFeature{v0.21} as for the
planets (see section \ref{sec:ssystem.ini:Planet} above), current
\indexterm{IAU} reference material gives axis orientation with right
ascension and declination values for the pole in ICRF coordinates,
with some of them in motion. So again, if one of the
\texttt{rot\_pole\_...} values exist, we assume the current
standard, but keep the old elements available until we find new data.
For more complicated motion, again some special functions
are applied.

\end{description}



\subsubsection{Observers}
\label{sec:ssystem.ini:Observers}

Stellarium is great for excursions to the surface of any object with
known orbital elements.  Configuring a viewpoint away from a planet
requires a special kind of location.

\paragraph{Solar System Observer}
\label{sec:ssystem.ini:SolarSystemObserver}

The Solar System Observer has
been provided as a neutral view location high above the North pole of
the Solar System. It has been configured like this:
\begin{configfile}
[solar_system_observer]
name=Solar System Observer
parent=Sun
halo=false
hidden=true
coord_func=ell_orbit
orbit_Inclination=90
orbit_MeanLongitude=90
orbit_Period=70000000000
orbit_SemiMajorAxis=70000000000
rot_obliquity=90
type=observer
\end{configfile}
Note the inclination and mean longitude of 90 degrees, and that it is \texttt{hidden} and has no \texttt{halo}. 

\paragraph{Planet Observers}
\label{sec:ssystem.ini:PlanetObserver}

There are other ``observer'' locations for all planets \newFeature{v0.19.2} which have moons: Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
They have all been provided as neutral view locations above the Northern hemisphere of
the respective planet. For example:
\begin{configfile}
[earth_observer]
name=Earth Observer
parent=Earth
halo=false
hidden=true
coord_func=ell_orbit
orbit_Inclination=90
orbit_MeanLongitude=90
orbit_Period=100000000000
orbit_SemiMajorAxis=149600000
rot_obliquity=90
type=observer
\end{configfile}

The distance \texttt{orbit\_semiMajorAxis} has been configured with a
distance that resembles the semimajor axis of the respective planet:
when you want to compare the views from Earth and from the observer,
light time correction should be at least approximately equal.

\subsection{File ssystem\_minor.ini}
\label{sec:ssystem.ini:minor}

\subsubsection{Minor Planet section}
\label{sec:ssystem.ini:MinorPlanet}

\begin{configfile}
[4vesta]
type=asteroid  
minor_planet_number=4
name=Vesta

coord_func=comet_orbit
parent=Sun
orbit_ArgOfPericenter=151.19843
orbit_AscendingNode=103.85141
orbit_Eccentricity=0.0887401
orbit_Epoch=2457000.5
orbit_Inclination=7.14043
orbit_MeanAnomaly=20.86389
orbit_MeanMotion=0.27154465
orbit_SemiMajorAxis=2.3617933
orbit_visualization_period=1325.46

color=1., 1., 1.
halo=true
oblateness=0.0

albedo=0.423
radius=280
absolute_magnitude=3.2
slope_parameter=0.32
tex_map=vesta.png
model=4vesta_21_MLfix.obj
\end{configfile}

\texttt{type} can be \texttt{asteroid, dwarf planet, cubewano,
  plutino, scattered disc object, Oort cloud object}. With the
exception of Pluto (which is included in \file{ssystem\_major.ini} and cannot be changed), 
all positions for minor bodies are computed with the orbiting elements given in this way. 

Note that although all minor planets orbit the sun in an
elliptical orbit, the \texttt{coord\_func=comet\_orbit}. However, it
is more common for minor planets to specify epoch, mean anomaly and
mean motion.

Visual magnitude is modelled from absolute magnitude $H$ and slope parameter $G$.

Elements for rotational axis may be given just like for planets when
they are known. It is recommended to use the modern specification
(elements \texttt{rot\_pole\_...}).

A few asteroids have been visited by spacecraft, \newFeature{v0.16.0}
and for many other asteroids visual observations of stellar occultations 
by asteroids and light curve measurements have enabled researchers to derive 
3D shape models of asteroids. If a model is available in the \file{models} 
subdirectory of the program directory, this can be configured with a \texttt{model} entry.

\subsubsection{Comet section}
\label{sec:ssystem.ini:Comet}

Comets are tiny, and their outgassing and close approaches to the
major planets cause fast changes in their orbital elements, so that
each apparition should be specified with a dedicated section in
\file{ssystem\_minor.ini}.

The coord\_func is always specified as \texttt{comet\_orbit}.  Note the
specification of a time (JDE) at pericenter which is typical for
comets.

Comet brightness is evaluated from
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:comet_magnitudes}
  \mathrm{mag}=\mathtt{absolute\_magnitude}+5\cdot\log{\mathrm{distance}} + 2.5\cdot\mathtt{slope\_parameter}\cdot\log(\mathrm{CometSunDistance})
\end{equation}

The term \texttt{slope\_parameter} may be a misnomer in case of
comets. From the literature \citep{AstronomicalAlgorithms:1998} (equation 33.13) we find
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:comet_magnitudes_Meeus}
  \mathrm{mag}=g+5\log\Delta + \kappa\log r
\end{equation}
from which $\kappa=2\cdot\mathtt{slope\_parameter}$. In any case, $\kappa$ is typically [5\ldots15] and specific for each comet.

\texttt{albedo} is used to set the brightness for rendering the body,
if you are close enough. 

A large number of elements for historical comets is provided in the
file \file{ssystem\_1000comets.ini} in the installation directory. You
can copy\&paste what you need into your
\file{ssystem\_minor.ini} or add all with the Solar System Editor plugin (section~\ref{sec:plugins:SolarSystemEditor}). 
Unfortunately it is not possible to specify
several sets of orbital elements for different epochs of one apparition which would
allow automatic changes.

\paragraph{Periodic Comet}
\label{sec:ssystem.ini:Comet:Periodic}

\begin{configfile}
[1phalley]
type=comet  
name=1P/Halley

coord_func=comet_orbit
parent=Sun [can be omitted]
orbit_ArgOfPericenter=111.7154
orbit_AscendingNode=58.8583
orbit_Eccentricity=0.968004
orbit_Inclination=162.2453
orbit_PericenterDistance=0.57136
orbit_TimeAtPericenter=2446463.12979167
orbit_good=780

color=1.0, 1.0, 1.0
dust_brightnessfactor=1.5
dust_lengthfactor=0.4
dust_widthfactor=1.5

albedo=0.1
radius=5
absolute_magnitude=5.5
slope_parameter=3.2
tex_map=nomap.png
model=1682q1halley_MLfix.obj [optional]
\end{configfile}

You may want to e.g.\ change the name in this entry
to \texttt{name=1P/Halley (1982i)}. Note a rather short
duration of \texttt{orbit\_good}, which means the comet is only displayed 780
days before and after perihelion.

Some comets have been visited by spacecraft so that shape models of their cores 
may be available and can be configured with a \texttt{model} entry.\newFeature{v0.16.0}

\paragraph{Parabolic/Hyperbolic Comet}
\label{sec:ssystem.ini:Comet:Parabolic}

\begin{configfile}
[c2013us10%28catalina%29]
type=comet
name=C/2013 US10 (Catalina)

coord_func=comet_orbit
parent=Sun 
orbit_ArgOfPericenter=340.3533
orbit_AscendingNode=186.141
orbit_Eccentricity=1.000372
orbit_Inclination=148.8766
orbit_PericenterDistance=0.822958
orbit_TimeAtPericenter=2457342.20748843
orbit_good=1000

color=1.0, 1.0, 1.0
dust_brightnessfactor=1.5
dust_lengthfactor=0.4
dust_widthfactor=1.5

albedo=0.1
radius=5
absolute_magnitude=4.4
slope_parameter=4
tex_map=nomap.png
\end{configfile}

This has basically the same format. Note that eccentricity is larger than 1,
this means the comet is following a slightly hyperbolic
orbit. Stellarium shows data for this comet for almost 3 years
(\texttt{orbit\_good=1000} days) from perihelion.
