# Balinese

## Introduction

Bali, one of the provinces in Indonesia, is a strategic island for cultural exchange, as the island is located between Java and Lombok Island. Most people recognize Bali as a tourist island; meanwhile, this refers to Bali Island, not Bali Province. Aside from Bali Island, Bali province has other small islands nearby, namely Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, Nusa Ceningan, Serangan, and Menjangan. The majority of Bali's population is Balinese Hindus, who are slightly different from Indian Hindus. They also have their own language, Balinese. Bali utilizes its territory as a primary source of income through tourism. However, before the 18th century, its inhabitants made their living in agriculture and fishing. Through the original lifestyle, they have a system for determining the right time to do rituals and live by interpreting the sky.
From its location, Balinese sky culture is one of the unique sky cultures in Indonesia due to its mixture of cultures. This sky culture has a mixture of influences from China and India through the religion transmission, Hindu-Buddhist, and trade. Polynesian influence existed earlier, given that Polynesians were accustomed to seafaring. Furthermore, it is known that most of the ancestors of Indonesians were sailors, which is supported by the fact that Indonesia is an archipelago.

## Description

In written form, Balinese sky culture is preserved in lontar or leaves of Borassus flabellifer or palmyra which is dried and used as a material for manuscript and antique crafts. This sky culture is related to Balinese calendar, and this system is Palelintangan. Palelintangan is a set of 35 asterisms that has a deep connection between cosmic movement and human life. Basically, they rely their daily activities based on which palelintangan is appear in that time. They believe each lintang of palelintangan has their own cosmos power to handle their work.

Palelintangan is formed by combining seven-day cycle (from Redite/Sunday to Saniscara/Saturday) and five-day cycle (from Umanis to Kliwon). Palelintangan adopted Nakṣatra system and combining with the earlier existing concept in Bali. 


### How this Sky Culture was made

Alfred Maaß made a report about his journey into an article titled "Astrologische Kalender der Balinesen"[#1]. In his article, he gave a description of each lintang in the Palelangan in the form of "Position in the Sky". But there are 10 lintangs that are not explained.
Then a team from the Bali Museum continued to study deeper about the Palelintangan for the ritual. Furthermore, they mentioned a little about lintang in the form of asterism. They explained that the X-star constellation was similar to the constellation Y (the constellation set by IAU).

With an explanation from the two main sources, we began to form Contellation Lines using Sky Culture Maker (SCM) from the description given, composed and triangulation. We have adjusted the full form of Contellation Lines to the images given by each lintang.

In anchoring the artwork, we chose to use the re-paint image from the existing sources with the condition that using older images and in accordance with the description given by the resource persons in the Maaß article. Based on the interviews we conducted with several people, namely Hindu Religious Instructors, Chair of the Bali Dharma Hindu Association and the seminar from Balinese astronomers, that the information contained in the Maaß manuscript can be used as a reference because this information comes from traditional leaders in Klungkung.
