**  Time scale transformation:  Universal Time, UT1, to International
**  Atomic Time, TAI.
**
**  Given:
**     ut11,ut12  double    UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date
**     dta        double    UT1-TAI in seconds
**
**  Returned:
**     tai1,tai2  double    TAI as a 2-part Julian Date
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                int       status:  0 = OK
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) ut11+ut12 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way
**     between the two arguments, for example where ut11 is the Julian
**     Day Number and ut12 is the fraction of a day.  The returned
**     tai1,tai2 follow suit.
**
**  2) The argument dta, i.e. UT1-TAI, is an observed quantity, and is
**     available from IERS tabulations.
