/* 2014 Mar 25:  notes about the file structure :

Bytes 0- 83:  first line ("JPL Planetary Ephemeris DExxx/LExxx")
     84-167:  second line ("Start Epoch: JED = ttttttt.t yyyy-MMM-dd 00:00:00")
    168-251:  third line ("Final Epoch: JED = ttttttt.t yyyy-MMM-dd 00:00:00")
    252-257:  first constant name ("DENUM ")
    252+6n to 257+6n:   nth constant name (0 <= n < 399)
    2646-2651:  400th constant name
    2652-2659:   ephem_start
    2660-2667:   ephem_end
    2668-2675:   ephem_step
    2676-2679:   ncon
    2680-2687:   AU in km: close to 149597870.700000
    2688-2695:   Earth/moon mass ratio: about 81.300569
         ...followed by 36 32-bit ints for the above 'ipt' array [12][3]...
    2840-2843:   ephemeris version (405,  430,  etc.)
         ...followed by three 32-bit ints for ipt[12][0...2].
    2844-2855:   ipt[12][0], ipt[12][1], ipt[12][2]
         Note that in the JPL FORTRAN code,
         ipt[12][0..2] become lpt[0..2] (the lunar libration offsets);
         ipt[13][0..2] become rpt[0..2] (the lunar euler angle rate offsets);
         ipt[14][0..2] become tpt[0..2] (the TT-TDB offsets)
         Further note that ipt[13] and [14] are new to DE-430t.  In older
         versions,  they're just zeroes.
    2856-2861:  name of 401th constant
    2862-2867:  name of 402st constant
         ...and after the last constant,  ipt[13][0..2] and ipt[14][0..2].
         If n_constants <= 400,  these will occupy bytes 2856-2879.  Otherwise,
         add (n_constants - 400) * 6 to get the byte offset.

         Notice that _most_ of the data in the jpl_eph_data struct is stored
         between bytes 2652 to 2839.  That gets us up to ipt[11][2].  In a
         sensible world,  this would be followed by ipt[12][0].  However,  it
         used to be that DE just gave eleven variables;  librations and
         TT-TDB are sort of an afterthought.  And furthermore,  having more
         than 400 constants was something of an afterthought,  too.  So you
         have ipts[0] to [11] stored contiguously;  then four bytes for the
         ephemeris version are stuck in there;  then twelve bytes for ipt[12],
         which may be zero;  then any "extra" (past 400) constant names;
         and _then_ 24 bytes for ipt[13] and ipt[14].

   recsize-recsize+8*ncon: actual values of the constants.
         recsize = 8 * ncoeff;  ncoeff,  thus far,  has been...
         ncoeff = 773 for DE-102
         ncoeff = 826 for DE-200 & 202
         ncoeff = 1018 for DE-403, 405, 406, 410, 414, 421, 422, 423, 424, 430, 431,
         ncoeff = 728 for DE-406
         ncoeff = 982 for DE-432, DE-432t
