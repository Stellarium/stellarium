0.8.0 [2013-05-31]
Some class interface cleanup.
Satellites list management:
- improved multiple selection handling and operations (toggling display and
orbit flags, etc.)
- editable satellite groups; adding custom groups
- localization of default satellite group names and satellite descriptions
- list entry indicates hint color
Update management:
- automatic adding of new satellites on update from selected update sources;
by default, only new naked-eye satellites are auto-added
- automatic removal of satellites if they are no longer listed in the update
sources
- "user-defined" flag protecting satellites from update/removal

WARNING! There have been changes to the config.ini section format, but they are
backwards-compatible.
