<h1>Babylonian &mdash; Seleucid</h1>
<p>The Seleucid Era in Babylonian history is the era of the successors of Alexander the Great who conquered Babylon in 331 BCE. In these days MUL.APIN (already thousand years old) was still copied and, thus, appears to have developed to be an old-fashioned but not outdated standard. Moreover, there is no alternative compendium like MUL.APIN from the Late Babylonian epoch.</p>
<p>This <em>Seleucid</em> or <em>Late Babylonian sky culture</em> is supposed to show the (estimated) state of Babylonian constellations contemporary to the Greek culture. There is no description of the full sky. Changes with regard to the MUL.APIN version have certainly applied in the zodiac since several centuries. This can be stated for sure because in this time, there is a blossoming zodiacal astrology. Since there had been no zodiac in MUL.APIN and the zodiac developed around the middle of the -1st millennium, in the 2nd half of the 1st millennium BCE, there had been different versions of the constellations around the ecliptic.  
 </p>
<p> 
 However, we do not know much about the rest of the sky. Hence, for the constellations far away from the zodiac, again the constellations of MUL.APIN can be taken as state of the art. Please see MUL.APIN sky culture for more information and use the MUL.APIN constellations for an impression of the Old Babylonian (or Middle Babylonian) sky culture. 
</p>
 <h3>Single Stars</h3>
 <p> 
 In contrast to constellations, there are much more lists of single stars preserved from the later epochs. We use this Late Babylonian or Seleucid sky culture to focus on the single star names. There are plenty of <i>ziqpu</i> lists (lists of culminating stars) and for measurements in the zodiac, "normal stars" have been introduced. Normal stars (from Latin "norma" = the measure) are a frame of reference for mathematical astrometry of the Late Babylonian epoch. While for most of the other stars the margin of error concerning their identification with a celestial counterpart is sometimes huge, the normal stars are identified properly because their coordinates can be derived from the planets standing next to them (Jones, 2004). 
</p>
<h3>Source(s)</h3>
<p>The lists of ziqpu stars and normal stars are mostly compiled from the modern compendium Hunger and Pingree: Astral Science in Mesopotamia, 1999 and some of the other papers given in "Further Reading". The book by Hoffmann, 2017 already contains several computations with these stars and more literature (e.g. Wayne Horowitz has worked on <i>ziqpu</i> stars for many years but is not mentioned here with a special paper although his translations contributed a lot for this study). A likely version of the Late Babylonian stick figures will be added in a later release of Stellarium.

Sirius was not a dog star in Babylonian sky culture but, however, important for the calendar.
