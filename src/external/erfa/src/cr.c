**  
**  The ERFA version is intended to retain identical functionality to
**  the SOFA library, but made distinct through different function and
**  file names, as set out in the SOFA license conditions.  The SOFA
**  original has a role as a reference standard for the IAU and IERS,
**  and consequently redistribution is permitted only in its unaltered
**  state.  The ERFA version is not subject to this restriction and
**  therefore can be included in distributions which do not support the
**  concept of "read only" software.
**  
**  Although the intent is to replicate the SOFA API (other than
**  replacement of prefix names) and results (with the exception of
**  bugs;  any that are discovered will be fixed), SOFA is not
**  responsible for any errors found in this version of the library.
**  
**  If you wish to acknowledge the SOFA heritage, please acknowledge

**  itself.
