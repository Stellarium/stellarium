# Indian Nakshatras

## Introduction

First historical proofs of nakṣatra are given in the Vedic culture which is archaeologically attested in the Indus Valley before 1000 BCE. It is known from traditional religious texts and rituals that astronomy was used for timekeeping in that time. When the Indus culture started to spread to the Ganges Plateau which has a different climate, flora and fauna, Vedic cultural astronomy was reworked and a new religious text of that time, the Arthavaveda, preserves a complete set of constellations. The first complete non-religious description, the Vedāṅgajyotiṣa, dates to roughly 300 BCE, and the standardized origin (Ashvini as first) was set in the first century BCE or CE. Hinduism took over the nakshatras. In the first centuries CE, astrological ideas from the Graeco-Babylonian world, including the zodiac as a division of the ecliptic into twelve equal sections, was added to the older Vedic nakshatra-division. Since the middle of the first millennium CE, the system is used in its present form. 

The number of stars per nakshatra-constellations may vary in different sources. In this sky culture, we present only one single historical source: the depictions in Tirupperunthurai (Athmanathaswamy temple) near Aranthangi, India, 10th century CE. There, they are drawn at two occasions in exactly the same way: engraved in a doorway of stone, and imprinted in a tiruvasi, a silver arch from the temple's main chamber. 

## Description

In the second millennium BCE, the nakshatras were likely observed as rising constellations were the moon stands. The moon travels roughly 12° per day (360° in 30 days). However, historians proved that in later times, the nakshatras were observed in culmination. The moon then stands in the meridian together with some constellations. It is much easier to observe simultaneous culminations, as the air mass is much thinner there than at the horizon. Additionally, it simplifies the coordinate system and timekeeping, as simultaneously culminating asterisms share the same right ascension (hour) circle. 

### Sky


### Moon and Sun

The nakshatras are defined as a circle of constellations to observe the motion of the moon. However, the Sun also travels the same path. The nakshatra of the sun is called the maLe nakshatra. 

### Planets

The planets travel the same path but were not considered. 

### Zodiac

The nakshatra are a lunar system, developed independent of the Babylonian zodiac but later merged with it due to exchange with the Greek culture which had adopted it already. 

### Milky Way

The Milky Way is not incorporated in this set.
