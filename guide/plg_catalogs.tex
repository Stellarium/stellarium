\section{Bright Novae Plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:BrightNovae}

\caption{Nova Cygni 1975 (also known as \textbf{V1500 Cyg})}
\label{fig:NovaCygni1975}
\end{figure}


\noindent The Bright Novae plugin provides visualization of some
bright novae in the Milky Way galaxy.
If enabled (see section~\ref{sec:Plugins:EnablingPlugins}), bright
novae from the past will be presented in the sky at the correct
times. For example, set date and time to 30 August 1975, look at the constellation \emph{Cygnus} to see
\emph{Nova Cygni 1975}\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V1500_Cygni}} (Fig.~\ref{fig:NovaCygni1975}).


\subsection{Section \big[Novae\big] in config.ini file}
%\label{sec:plugins:BrightNovae:configuration}

You can edit \file{config.ini} file by yourself for changes of the
settings for the Bright Novae plugin -- just make it carefully!

\noindent%
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l|l|X}\toprule
\emph{ID}            & \emph{Type} & \emph{Description}\\\midrule
last\_update            & string & Date and time of last update\\%\midrule
update\_frequency\_days & int    & Frequency of updates, in days\\%\midrule

url                     & string & URL of bright novae catalog \\\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Format of bright novae catalog}
\label{sec:plugins:BrightNovae:format}

To add a new nova, open a new line after line 5 and paste the following, note commas and brackets, they are important:

\begin{configfile}
"Nova designation":
{
    "name": "name of nova",
    "type": "type of nova",
    "maxMagnitude": value of maximal visual magnitude,
    "minMagnitude": value of minimal visual magnitude,
    "peakJD": JD for maximal visual magnitude,
    "m2": Time to decline by 2mag from maximum (in days),
    "m3": Time to decline by 3mag from maximum (in days),
    "m6": Time to decline by 6mag from maximum (in days),
    "m9": Time to decline by 9mag from maximum (in days),
    "distance": value of distance between nova and 
                Earth (in thousands of Light Years),
    "RA": "Right ascension (J2000)",
    "Dec": "Declination (J2000)"
},
\end{configfile}

\noindent For example, the record for \textbf{Nova Cygni 1975} (\textbf{V1500 Cyg}) looks like:
\begin{configfile}
"V1500 Cyg":
{
    "name": "Nova Cygni 1975",
    "type": "NA",
    "maxMagnitude": 1.69,
    "minMagnitude": 21,
    "peakJD": 2442655,
    "m2": 2,
    "m3": 4,
    "m6": 32,
    "m9": 263
    "distance": 6.36,
    "RA": "21h11m36.6s",
    "Dec": "48d09m02s"
},
\end{configfile}

\subsection{Light curves}
\label{sec:plugins:BrightNovae:lightcurves}

This plugin uses a very simple model for calculation of light curves for
novae stars. This model is based on time for decay by $N$
magnitudes from the maximum value, where $N$ is 2, 3, 6 and 9. If a
nova has no values for decay of magnitude then this plugin will use
generalized values for it.

\section{Historical Supernovae Plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:HistoricalSupernovae}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sn1604wiki.png}
\caption{Supernova 1604 (also known as \textbf{Kepler's Supernova}, \textbf{Kepler's Nova} or \textbf{Kepler's Star})}
\label{fig:SN1604}
\end{figure}


\noindent Similar to the Historical Novae plugin
(section~\ref{sec:plugins:BrightNovae}), the Historical Supernovae
plugin provides visualization of bright historical supernovae
(Fig.~\ref{fig:SN1604}) from the table below.
If enabled (see section~\ref{sec:Plugins:EnablingPlugins}), bright
supernovae from the past will be presented in the sky at the correct
times. For example, set date and time to 29 April 1006, and look at the constellation \emph{Lupus} to see \emph{SN 1006A}.

\subsection{Light curves}
\label{sec:plugins:HistoricalSupernovae:lightcurves}

In this plugin a simple model of light curves for different supernovae
has been implemented (Figure~\ref{fig:SNTypeI+II}). 
%% GZ I try to save 1 page by combining the figures. 
While Type~I supernovae show a peak and slow but steady decay, Type~II supernovae show a longer ``plateau'' in the decay curve.

%A typical light curve used in the plugin for
%supernova type~I is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SNTypeI} (bottom scale in
%days).

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{exoplanets.png}
\caption{Planetary system $\tau$ Ceti}
\label{fig:Exoplanets}
\end{figure}

\noindent This plugin plots the position of stars with
exoplanets. Exoplanets data is derived from ``The Extrasolar Planets
Encyclopaedia''\footnote{\url{http://exoplanet.eu/}}. List of
potential habitable exoplanets and data about them were taken from
``The Habitable Exoplanets
Catalog''\footnote{\url{http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog}}
by the Planetary Habitability
Laboratory\footnote{\url{http://phl.upr.edu/home}}.  If enabled (see
section~\ref{sec:Plugins:EnablingPlugins}), just click on the
Exoplanet button \guibutton{0.6}{btExoplanets-off.png} on the bottom
toolbar to display markers for the stars with known exoplanets. You
can then either click on such a marked star or find the stars with
exoplanets by their designation (e.g., \emph{24 Sex}) in the \key{F3} dialog (see~\ref{sec:gui:search}).


\subsection{Potential habitable exoplanets}
\label{sec:plugins:Exoplanets:habitable}
This plugin can display potential habitable exoplanets (orange marker) and some information about those planets.

\begin{description}
\item[Planetary Class] Planet classification from host star spectral
  type (F, G, K, M; see
  section~\ref{sec:Phenomena:SpectralTypeLuminosityClass}), habitable
  zone (hot, warm, cold) and size (miniterran, subterran, terran,
  superterran, jovian, neptunian) (Earth = G-Warm Terran).
\item[Equilibrium Temperature] The planetary equilibrium
  temperature\footnote{\url{http://lasp.colorado.edu/~bagenal/3720/CLASS6/6EquilibriumTemp.html}}
  is a theoretical temperature (in \degree C) that the planet would be
  at when considered simply as if it were a black body being heated
  only by its parent star (assuming a 0.3 bond albedo). As example the
  planetary equilibrium temperature of Earth is -18.15\degree C (255~K).
\item[Earth Similarity Index (ESI)] Similarity to
  Earth\footnote{\url{http://phl.upr.edu/projects/earth-similarity-index-esi}}
  on a scale from 0 to 1, with 1 being the most Earth-like. ESI
  depends on the planet's radius, density, escape velocity, and
  surface temperature.

\noindent In contrast and extension of the random \emph{shooting stars}
feature of Stellarium (see section~\ref{sec:Phenomena:Meteoroids}), this 
plugin provides data for real meteor showers and a marker for each 
active and inactive radiant, showing real information about its activity. 
If enabled (see section~\ref{sec:Plugins:EnablingPlugins}), just click 
on the Meteor Showers button \guibutton{0.6}{btMS-off.png}  on the bottom
toolbar to display markers for the radiants.


%% TODO: Consider moving to the astronomical phenomena chapter on meteor(oid)s?
\subsection{Terms}
\label{sec:plugins:MeteorShowers:terms}

\paragraph{Meteor shower}
A \indexterm{meteor shower} is a celestial event in which a number of
meteors are observed to radiate, or originate, from one point in the
night sky. These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called
\indexterm{meteoroids} entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on
parallel trajectories. Most meteors are smaller than a grain of sand,
so almost all of them disintegrate and never hit the Earth's
surface. Intense or unusual meteor showers are known as meteor
outbursts and meteor storms, which may produce greater than 1,000
meteors an hour.

\paragraph{Radiant}

The \indexterm{radiant} or \indexterm{apparent radiant} of a meteor
shower is the point in the sky from which (to a planetary observer)
meteors appear to originate. The Perseids, for example, are meteors
which appear to come from a point within the constellation of Perseus.

An observer might see such a meteor anywhere in the sky but the
direction of motion, when traced back, will point to the radiant. A
meteor that does not point back to the known radiant for a given
shower is known as a sporadic and is not considered part of that
shower.

Many showers have a radiant point that changes position during the
interval when it appears. For example, the radiant point for the Delta
Aurigids drifts by more than a degree per night.

\paragraph{Zenithal Hourly Rate (ZHR)}

The \indexterm{Zenithal Hourly Rate} (ZHR) of a meteor
shower is the number of meteors a single observer would see in one
hour under a clear, dark sky (limiting apparent magnitude of 6.5) if
the radiant of the shower were at the zenith. The rate that can
effectively be seen is nearly always lower and decreases the closer
the radiant is to the horizon.

\paragraph{Population index}

The \indexterm{population index} indicates the magnitude distribution
of the meteor showers. Values below 2.5 correspond to
distributions where bright meteors are more frequent than average,
while values above 3.0 mean that the share of faint meteors is larger
than usual.

\subsection{Section \big[MeteorShowers\big] in config.ini file}

You can edit \file{config.ini} file by yourself for changes of the
settings for the Meteor Showers plugin~-- just make it carefully!

\label{fig:plugin:NavigationalStars}
\end{figure}

\noindent This plugin marks navigational stars from a selected set:
\begin{description}
	\item[Anglo-American] --- the 57 "selected stars" that are listed in \emph{The Nautical Almanac}\footnote{The Nautical Almanac
		website -- \url{http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/na.php}} jointly published by Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office and the US Naval Observatory since 1958; consequently, these stars are also used in navigational aids such as the \emph{2102-D Star Finder}\footnote{Rude Starfinder 2102-D
		description and usage instruction --
		\url{http://oceannavigation.blogspot.ru/2008/12/rude-starfinder-2102-d.html}} and \emph{Identifier}. 
	\item[French] --- the 81 stars that are listed in the \emph{Ephémérides Nautiques} published by the French Bureau des Longitudes.
	\item[Russian] --- the 160 stars that are listed in the Russian Nautical Almanac.
\end{description}
If enabled (see section~\ref{sec:Plugins:EnablingPlugins}), just click
on the Sextant button \guibutton{0.6}{bt_NavStars-off.png} on
the bottom toolbar to display markers for the navigational stars. This
can help you in training your skills in astronomical navigation before
you cruise the ocean in the traditional way, with your sextant and
chronometer.

\section{Satellites Plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:Satellites}

%% GZ: Found on Wiki on 2016-04 with a deprecation note. Still better than nothing!
%% Original URL: http://www.stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/Satellites_plugin
%% TODO: Update from there or write new.

\noindent The Satellites plugin displays the positions of artifical satellites in Earth's orbit based on a catalog of orbital data. It allows
automatic updates from online sources and manages a list of update
file URLs.

To calculate satellite positions, the plugin uses an implementation of
the SGP4/SDP4 algorithms (J.L. Canales' \program{gsat} library), using
as its input data in NORAD's two-line element set
(TLE\footnote{TLE: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-line_element_set}})
format. Lists with TLEs for hundreds of satellites are available
online and are regularly updated. The plugin downloads the lists
prepared by \url{http://celestrak.com} to keep itself up-to-date, but the users can
specify other sources online or load updates from local files.

If enabled (see
section~\ref{sec:Plugins:EnablingPlugins}), just click on the
Satellite button \guibutton{0.6}{bt_hint.png}  on the bottom
toolbar to display markers for the satellites.

It should now be possible to search for artificial satellites using
the regular search dialog (\key{F3}). Note that at any given time, most
Satellites will be below the horizon.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Satellite Properties}
\label{sec:plugins:Satellites:properties}

\begin{description}
\item[Name and identifiers] Each satellite has a name. It's displayed as a label of the satellite hint and in the list of satellites. Names are not unique though, so they are used only
for presentation purposes.

\item[Satellite Catalog] In the \emph{Satellite Catalog} satellites are uniquely identified by their NORAD number, which is encoded in TLEs.

\item[Grouping]
A satellite can belong to one or more groups such as ``amateur'',
``geostationary'' or ``navigation''. They have no other function but
to help the user organize the satellite collection.  Group names are
arbitrary strings defined in the Satellite Catalog for each satellite
and are more similar to the concept of tags than a hierarchical
grouping. A satellite may also not belong to any group at all.

By convention, group names are in lowercase. The GUI translates some of the groups used in the default catalog.
\end{description}

\subsection{Iridium Flares prediction}
\label{sec:plugins:Satellites:IridiumFlares}

The Satellite plugin might predict Iridium flares for the current location up to 2 weeks in the future from the current moment. The calculations of visual magnitude based on standard magnitude, orientation of satellite and places an observer and Sun. Of course all predictions can be saved in the CSV file (Figure~\ref{fig:plugins:Satellites:IridiumFlares}).

\caption{Prediction of Iridium flares in the Satellites plugin.}
\label{fig:plugins:Satellites:IridiumFlares}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Satellite Catalog}
\label{sec:plugins:Satellites:catalog}

The satellite catalog is stored on the disk in JSON\footnote{\url{http://www.json.org/}}
format, in a file named \file{satellites.json}. A default copy is embedded in the plug-in at compile time. A working copy is kept in the user data directory.

%   Used in Satellites plug-in 0.7.1 and later (Stellarium 0.11.2 and later) 

To add a new satellite, open a new line after line 5 and paste the following, note commas and brackets, they are important:
\begin{configfileScr}
"NORAD number": 
{
  "name": "name of the satellite"
  "description": "description goes here",
  "comms": [
     {
  	"description": "downlink 1",
  	"frequency": 437.49,
  	"modulation": "AFSK 1200 bps"
     },
     {
  	"description": "downlink 2",
  	"frequency": 145.825
     }
  ],
  "groups": ["group1", "group2"],
  "stdMag": 2.0,
  "tle1": "1 12345U 90005D   09080.85236265  .00000014  00000-0  20602-4 0  5632",
  "tle2": "2 12345 98.2700  53.2702 0011918  71.1776 289.0705 14.31818920   653",
  "visible": true
},
\end{configfileScr}
Explanation of the fields:

\begin{description}
\item[NORAD number]  required parameter, surrounded by double quotes (\texttt{"}),
followed by a colon (\texttt{:}). It is used internally to identify the
satellite. You should replace the text \texttt{"NORAD number"} with the first number on both lines of the TLE set (in this case, \texttt{"12345"}). It must match the number of the satellite in the source you are adding from if you want the TLE to be automatically updated.
\end{description}
The remaining parameters should be listed between two curly brackets and the closing curly bracket must be followed by a comma to separate it from the next satellite in the list:

\begin{description}
\item[name] required parameter. It will be displayed on the screen and used
when searching for the satellite with the Find window. Use the
description field for a more readable name if you like. (The
description field can accept HTML tags such as \texttt{<br/>} (new line), \texttt{<b></b>} (bold), etc.)

\item[description] optional parameter, double quoted. Appears when you click on the satellite \item[comms] optional parameter, square bracketed list of curly bracketed communications information.
\item[groups]  optional parameter, comma separated list of double quoted group names contained in square brackets. Used for grouping satellites in the drop down box on the config (see above)
\item[tle1]  required, line 1 of the TLE, must be contained in double quotes and begin with \texttt{"1~"}
\item[tle2]  required, line 2 of the TLE, must be contained in double quotes and begin with \texttt{"2~"}
\item[visible]  required parameter, set to true if you want to see it, this can be toggled from the configuration window once the satellite is loaded. 
\item[stdMag]  optional parameter, contained standard magnitude of satellite. 
\end{description}
You can edit the tags for a satellite, modify the description and comms data, and even add new satellites. 

\subsection{Configuration}
%\label{sec:plugins:Satellites:configuration}

The plug-in's configuration data is stored in Stellarium's main configuration
file.


\subsection{Sources for TLE data}

\begin{description}
\item[Celestrak]\footnote{\url{http://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/}} used as default update source, it also has TLE lists
  beyond those included by default in Satellite plug-in
\item[TLE.info]\footnote{\url{http://www.tle.info/joomla/index.php}}
\item[Space Track]\footnote{\url{http://www.space-track.org/}} the definitive source, requires signup, operated by
