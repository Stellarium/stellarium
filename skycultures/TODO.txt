Big issues in Skycultures as of 25.1

GENERAL: Many SCs have constellations with non-mnemonic abbreviations. They could be converted to good use.

arabic_arabian_peninsula: pronunciation missing
arabic_indigenous: pronunciation missing
arabic_lunar_mansions: pronunciation missing
armintxe: NO LICENSE (It is withheld anyhow due to implausibility)
babylonian_mulapin: use 0-length string as native placeholders, later add cuneiform
babylonian_seleucid: use 0-length string as native placeholders, later add cuneiform
belarusian: native->pronounce, add cyrillic to native
boorong: untranslated native star names to "english" or "native" tags?
chinese: constellation names native->pronounce (and add diacritics!), add real native. 
         star names: one dict has english=pinyin. Combine both dicts into one with english/pronunciation. 
	             Optional: add native in Chinese characters.
chinese_medieval: constellation names native->pronounce (and add diacritics!), add real native. 
                  star names: properly split english "pinyin/translation". Add diacritics?
