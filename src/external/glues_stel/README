GLU ES version 1.4

This port is based on original GLU 1.3 and has original libutil and libtess
(part of GLU) only.

Warning, after gluCylinder(), gluDisk(), gluPartialDisk(), gluSphere() function
call, color, vertex, texture and normal arrays are disabled. Array pointers are
changed and must be reinstalled by caller to its original state.

Currently QNX 6.4.x native target build is supported and Win32 x86 build for
PowerVR OpenGL ES 1.1 emulator (http://www.imgtec.com).

Win32 build uses MSVC 2005 (9.0) and you have to change path to Imagination
Technologies PowerVR SDK in all project files.

      calculations. Added Win32 build target for PowerVR OpenGL ES 1.1
