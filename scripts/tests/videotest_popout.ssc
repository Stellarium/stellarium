// Description: This script plays a video file with an interesting intro/exit.
//              Note that video support is a build-time option and
//              may not be supported for the version of Stellarium
//              which you have.  Also, different platforms may
//              support different video formats.

// Note: having show=false causes an assert failure (crash) on Windows Debug builds. It is OK in release builds.
