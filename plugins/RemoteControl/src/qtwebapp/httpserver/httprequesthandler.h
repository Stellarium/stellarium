   The request handler generates a response for each HTTP request. Web Applications
   usually have one central request handler that maps incoming requests to several
   controllers (servlets) based on the requested path.
   <p>
   You need to override the service() method or you will always get an HTTP error 501.
   <p>
   @warning Be aware that the main request handler instance must be created on the heap and
   that it is used by multiple threads simultaneously.
   @see StaticFileController which delivers static local files.
