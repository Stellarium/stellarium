 * Implement dirent-style opendir/readdir/closedir on Window 95/NT
 *
 * Functions defined are opendir(), readdir() and closedir() with the
 * same prototypes as the normal dirent.h implementation.
 *
 * Does not implement telldir(), seekdir(), rewinddir() or scandir(). 
 * The dirent struct is compatible with Unix, except that d_ino is 
 * always 1 and d_off is made up as we go along.
 *
 * The DIR typedef is not compatible with Unix.
