<h1 align="center">The Skyscape: Ticuna Constellations and Seasonality</h1>

<h3 align="justify">Priscila Faulhaber<br>MAST (Museum of Astronomy and Related Sciences), Brazil</br></h3>

<p align="justify">The movements of the Ticuna constellations correspond to an interpretation of the seasonality of rainfall, as the Ticuna narratives suggest. These constellations are related to myths referencing the ascension and fall of Wücütcha (a heavenly beast related to the Jaguar Clan), Coyatchicüra (Cayman’s Jaw) and Baweta (Tracajá, the Aquatic Turtle Collective), and the Anteater’s fight with the Jaguar and the Way of the Tapir. According to the Ticuna indigenous people testimony, Baweta appears in the eastern sky at nightfall towards the end of November. After Baweta rises, Cayman’s Jaw comes up. Wücütcha’s Leg corresponds to Orion and it begins to disappear from the western sky beginning on the 20th of May at nightfall. Some days later, the Cayman’s Jaw, corresponding to Taurus, also disappears to the West.</p>
<h3 align="center"> The Ticuna people</h3>
<p align="justify">The Ticuna indigenous people have inhabited the region of the Upper Solimões river for the past two thousand years, currently occupying a territory, in which the political frontiers of three countries converge: Brazil, Colombia and Peru. This is the reason why the Ticuna recognize themselves as a differentiated indigenous group and also perceive the different national identities related to these three countries.</p>
<p align="justify">Ticuna territory takes in a region 600 kilometers long, running west to east from the Chimbote region in Peru, along the emptiness of the Amazonas-Solimões valley in the so-called Colombian Amazonian Trapezoid, to the Barreira da Missão region in the municipality of Tefé in the Brazilian state of Amazonas (See The Ticuna Atlas Map, Figure I).</p>
 <p align="justify">The agencies and researchers that deal with this people estimate that more than 53,544 (Siasi/Sesai, 2014) live in Brazil (FUNASA, 2009), 8,000 in Colombia (Goulard, 2009) and 6,982 in Peru (INEL, 2007)<cite id="cit1a"><a href="#cit1"><B>¹</B></a></cite> . Together, they constitute the Amazonian  largest indigenous population. Aside from their own Ticuna language, they also speak Spanish and Portuguese, depending on whether they live in Colombia and Peru or in Brazil.</p>
<p align="justify">The Ticuna live in riverside villages along the Amazonas-Solimões tributary igarapés (or headwaters). Their daily life revolves around the cultivation cycles of different agricultural goods, most particularly manioc, which is used to produce the flour sold by Ticuna in the markets of the main cities of the region. They are also fishers, hunters and gatherers of the forest products. The women make hammocks, bags and other objects with plant fibers and the men paint on tururi fiber and fabricate arrows, paddles and canoes.</p>
<p align="justify">The legends say that the mythical twin brothers Yoi and Ipi created the Ticuna. Ipi’s flesh was converted into fish and Yoi caught these fish in the mythical Eware igarapé. The fishes transformed themselves into Ticuna people when brought upon land. Yoi taught them to work and celebrate and he gave them clan names associated with birds and land animals to organize the Ticuna society.</p>
<h3 align="center"> The Astronomic Correlations</h3>
<p align="justify">The astronomic correlations between Western and Ticuna constellations were identified by the Ticuna in November 2002 with the help of the astronomer Fernando Vieira (Planetarium Foundation of Rio de Janeiro City) during a study in the Science Center and Planetarium of the Universidade do Pará (CCPP) in the city of Belém   (Brazil), also using the Starry Night System. We are integrating in this investigation a Physics Professor at Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo (PUC-SP), and Astronomy in Culture researcher Walmir Thomazi Cardoso, who made some reinterpretations in a collaborative work with physics undergraduate student and Stellarium developer collaborator Youssif Ghanthous Filho, adapting and anchoring original drawings to the Stellarium. Nevertheless, every sky interpretation is contextual and circumstantial. Current collaborative investigations are looking for new astronomical observation together with the Ticuna, which will improve the initial findings.</p>
<p align="justify">Correlating the Ticuna constellations with those of Western astronomy<cite id="cit2a"><a href="#cit2"><B>²</B></a></cite> , the form of Baweta (the Turtle Collective) is associated with the stars of the asterisms of the Pleiades and of Perseus. Its eyes are the feet of Perseus (Omicron Persei and Atik). The head of the V form that Western astronomy relates to Taurus is called Coyatchicüra (Cayman’s Jaw). In a Ticuna drawing, the Cayman’s left paw corresponds to the star Euratis and the right rear paw to ε (Epsilon), η (Eta) ζ (zeta). The tail is in ο (Omicrom) and ζ (Zeta) in Perseus. In turn, Wücütcha’s Leg is related to the stars that groups as Orion. The toes are Orion’s Belt and the bend of the legs are α (Alfa), γ (Gama),β (Beta), ε (Epsilon).</p>
<p align="justify">Throughout the summer, the Anteater’s (Tchatü) Fight with the Jaguar (Ai) takes place<cite id="cit3a"><a href="#cit3"><B>³</B></a></cite> , the end of which coincides with the death and ascension of Wücütcha. Anteater’s eyes are in β in the Austral Triangle, his tail in the Austral Crown and body in the constellations of Norma and Ara. The Jaguar’s right paw is in α (Antares), σ (Sigma) and τ (Tau) in Scorpion; his eyes are in ε e μ, also in Scorpion and his left paw is in γ (Shaula) ν (nu) ι (iota) and θ (Theta) of the same constellation. According to the Ticuna, this was the result of the rape/murder of a pregnant woman. The victim’s relatives killed the beast associated with the Jaguar Clan to prevent the eclipse. Tchatü’s leaving the sky to the west at nightfall in the end of November coincides with the reappearance of Wücütcha’s Leg to the East, representing the beginning of the rainy season. Those correlations are illuminated by indigenous testimony reproduced bellow:</p>
<h3 align="center">The indigenous testimonies</h3>
<p align="justify">“The stars fit into their respective constellations. First is Wücütcha. After winter, summer begins to walk. It’s the Jaguar. After him comes Coyathicüra in the month of May, at nightfall, when the Cayman’s Jaw appears on the beach. Baweta appears in September, the month of the turtle. In May, Wücütcha and Coyatchicüra fall. All fall together at the end of May. In July, they come again. Baweta already begins to appear in July. When Wücütcha falls, beginning in May, Caymans and turtles begin to appear. The apex is in September”.</p>
<p align="justify">“In May, all the constellations fall, together with their planets. It’s summertime. Later, in July, they appear again for the New Year. Coya and Wücütcha leave the sky from May to September. Later, in July, they appear again.” (Fernando Marques or Ütchancu – translated by Lucho)</p>
<p align="justify">According to the explanations found in Enepü (a Ticuna community in the indigenous Land Eware II, corresponding to the Brazilian State of Amazon, in the Western Amazonia), the influence of seasonality upon Ticuna subsistence activities is more marked along the Solimões given that in the headwaters of the igarapés, where Enepü is situated, plenty exists all year long. In Enepü, trees such as the ingá, and palms such as the açaí are fertile all year long due to the “virginity” and the enrichment of the soil by natural compost. The same thing occurs with the fishing in Lake Preto within the limits of Enepü, where people living are able to supply themselves abundantly with fish all year long. On the Solimões, however, one finds fish only from April to July, when the water level drops. Abundance in the hunt is also from April to July/September along the Solimões. Fishing becomes more difficult when the river is up. The fruit of the native açaí palm is collected in summer, and customarily, saved for preparation during winter, the time of poor hunting and fishing. Through planning and regular gardening, agricultural harvests are available all year long. The harvest of cultivated plants also occurs during the drought months. A certain degree of flexibility exists in the adaptation of the agricultural and extractive calendar to the rainy season, when fishing and hunting are not productive, and the dry season, when fishing is more abundant but the difficulties involved in navigation and transport grow as the water level along the igarapés linking the river drops. Traditional culture is not prepared, however, for unforeseen alterations in the rainy season such as it occurred in 2002. In that year, July saw the beginning of the repiquete (the rise on water levels), which normally occurs in September. This destroyed the short-range agricultural cycle and made the fish scarcer, changing alimentary habits.</p>

 <p align="justify" id="cit2"> <a href="#cit2a"><B>2</B></a><cite> Alan Feitosa (CCPP) plotted the charts that the Ticuna Pedro Inácio Pinheiro and Luís Angel Ramos used to draw the corresponding Ticuna constellations. The calculations were established based upon: 70° W and 3°S  with the help of Oswaldo dos Santos Barros, Pará State (CCPP). We took into account   that in Brazil the Ticuna Indians live in the Indigenous Lands recognized by the Brazilian State indigenous policy sited in terrestrial “islands” among no indigenous Brazilian Population from Tabatinga to Manaus (As illustration se the Atlas das terras indígenas do Brasil (Brazilian Indigenous Lands Atlas).  Fernando Vieira (Planetarium Foudations of Rio de Janeiro) plotted the correspondence between the traces of Ticuna mythical animals and the Western constellations of western astronomy. He also reviewed this text  any skyscape incongruences related to corresponding Western astronomy and Ticuna cosmovision. Different drawings interpretations developing from ongoing collaborative investigation with Walmir T. Cardoso, Astronomy in Culture researcher consider some changes such as shown in this work. Barthelemy D’Ans (Instituto Peruano de Astronomia, Planetarium Maria Reich Lima-Ica-Nasca-Colca-Cusco), edited the panoramic picture and adapted it to the horizons of the Stellarium Astronomy Software. Marcio D´Olne Campos (UNICAMP and SULear/SOUTHing Proposal) helped in map location of the Ticuna village and definition of its latitude and longitude coordinates (See Ticuna Lands Atlas).Cláudia Lopez (Goeldi Museum, BRAZI) helped in the Ticuna people ethnographic characterization. </p></cite>
