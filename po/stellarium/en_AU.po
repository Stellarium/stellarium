"The Acronychal rise (or set) of an object happens when the object rises (or "
"sets) just when the Sun sets (or rises), respectively. The exact dates of "
"these ephemeris depend on the Observer's location. The dates between the "
"Acronychal set and rise are those when the altitude of the celestial object "
"uses to be high when the Sun is well below the horizon (hence the object can "
"be well observed). On the contrary, the Cosmical rise (or set) happens when "
"both, the object and the Sun, rise (or set) simultaneously. It is obvious "
"that the source is hardly observable (or not observable at all) in the dates "
"between Cosmical set and rise."

"separation from the Sun (no matter if it is a planet or a star), it "
"culminates roughly at midnight, and on the darkest possible area of the Sky "
"at that declination. Hence, that is the 'best' night to observe a particular "

"The program computes the range of dates when the celestial object is above "

"considers the time span when the Sun altitude is below that of the twilight "
"(which can be set by the user; see above). When the objects are fixed on the "
"sky (or are exterior planets), the range of observable epochs for the "
"current year can have two possible forms: either a range from one date to "
"another (e.g., 20 Jan to 15 Sep) or in two steps (from 1 Jan to a given date "
"and from another date to 31 Dec). In the first case, the first date (20 Jan "
"in our example) shall be close to the so-called 'Heliacal rise of a star' "
"and the second date (15 Sep in our example) shall be close to the 'Heliacal "
"set'. In the second case (e.g., a range in the form 1 Jan to 20 May and 21 "
"Sep to 31 Dec), the first date (20 May in our example) would be close to the "
"Heliacal set and the second one (21 Sep in our example) to the Heliacal "
"rise. More exact equations to estimate the Heliacal rise/set of stars and "
"planets (which will not depend on the mere input of a twilight Sun elevation "
"by the user) will be implemented in future versions of this plugin."
