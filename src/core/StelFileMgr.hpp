//! Provides utilities for locating and handling files.
//! StelFileMgr provides functions for locating files.  It maintains a list of
//! directories in which to look for files called the search path. Typcially this
//! includes the Stellarium installation directory, and a per-user settings
//! directory (on platforms which support it).
//! The concept is that the StelFileMgr will be asked for a named path, and it
//! will try to locate that path within each of the search directories.

	//! @enum Flags used as named bitfield flags as specifiers to filter results of StelFileMgr methods.
	enum Flags {
		RemovableMedia = 0x00000001,	//!< Search on removable media if present (default is not to).
		Writable       = 0x00000002,	//!< Only return writable paths. For directories this means
						//!< that it is possible to create files within the directory.

	};

	//! Initialize the directories.
	//! By default, StelFileMgr will be created with the Stellarium installation directory
	//! config_root in the search path. On systems which provide a per-user data/settings
	//! directory (which we call the user_settings directory, this is also included in
	//! the search path, before the \<config_root> directory.
	static void init();

	//! Search for a path within the search paths, for example "textures/fog.png".
	//! findFile looks through the search paths in order, returning the first instance
	//! of the specified path.  By specifying a flags parameter it is possible to constrain
	//! the results to those matching various criteria.
	//! If the path argument is a complete path (is a full path on single root OSes, or
	//! unambigiously identifies one and only one file on multi-root OSes), it will
	//! be tested for compliance with other conditions - the regular search path will
	//! not be tested.
	//! If you wish to search for a non-existing file which is not in the search path
	//! you should explicitly prefix it with "./", or otherwise have a . at the start of
	//! the path parameter, e.g. path="./my_config_file_in_the_pwd.ini"
	//! @param path the name of the file to search for, for example "textures/fog.png".
	//! @param flags options which constrain the result.
	//! @return returns a full path of the file if found, else return an empty path.
