0.15.0 [2016-07-31]
In memory of our team member Barry Gerdes.

Version 0.15.0 is based on Qt5.6. Starting with this version, some graphics cards 
have been blacklisted by Qt and are automatically forced to use ANGLE on Windows. 
We introduce a major internal change with the StelProperty system. 
This allows simpler access to internal variables and therefore more ways of operation. 
Most notably this version introduces an alternative control option via RemoteControl, 
a new webserver interface plugin. 
We also introduce another milestone towards providing better astronomical accuracy for 
historical applications: experimental support of getting planetary positions from JPL DE430 and 
  DE431 ephemerides. This feature is however not fully tested yet. 

- Added StelProperty system
- Added new plugin for exhibitions and planetariums - Remote Control
- Added new skycultures: Macedonian, Ojibwe, Dakota/Lakota/Nakota, 
  Kamilaroi/Euahlayi
- Updated code of plugins
- Added Bookmarks tool and updated AstroCalc tool
- Added new functions for Scripting Engine and new scripts
- Added Miller Cylindrical Projection
- Added updates and improvements in DSO and star catalogues (include initial 
  support of The Washington Double Star Catalog)
- azimuth lines (also targetting geographic locations) in ArchaeoLines plugin	
- Many fixes and improvements...

In addition, we prepared a new user guide.

0.14.0 [2015-10-24]
A big leap forward in astronomical accuracy for historical applications:
 - Precession now follows the IAU2006 model in the long-time version from Vondrak 
   et al. 2011.
 - Nutation is applied (IAU2000B solution). Given that nobody has observed it without 
   telescope and the model does not give limits of applicability, we limit its application 
   to 1500..2500
 - Application of DeltaT has been simplified and made a bit more intuitive.

We now dare to add another coordinate system: Ecliptic coordinates of date.

We can therefore now show that planetary positions given by the commonly used solution 
VSOP87 is applicable to -4000..+8000 only, and its use outside this range will give 
somewhat artificial results. There is more to follow in future versions.

The other big addition is a greatly improved collection of DSO data with lots of 
possibilities in a new GUI tab to select for object type and/or catalog. In total, 
15 catalogs are now built-in!

Also the Meteor Shower, Satellites, Telescope Control and 3D Sceneries plugins have 
been improved.

Landscapes can have switchable labels, so you can e.g. indicate mountain peaks.

In total 83 bugs and wishlist items were fixed or at least decided.

A platform-specific change for Windows: OpenGL binding is now dynamic. That means, there are 
no more separate OpenGL/ANGLE/MESA downloads, but after installation you will have separate 
commands in the start menu which force ANGLE or MESA modes.

Fixed Venus too small bug.
Fixed minor bugs from sourceforge bug reports.

0.6.0rc1 [27/04/2004]
Removed the previous patch to configure SDL because it caused some error on some systems.
Changed the global coordinate system into the conventionnal astronomical one (ie with z axis toward top and x toward us)
Stopped using the previous unreliable astro library with badly defined licence and use 2 libraries created from modified/simplified version of the LGPL library libnova. One called stellastro which manages the astronomical operations like time management etc. and another one called stellplanet which only computes the planetary positions.
Removed the module/class planet_mgr and use a hierarchical unified planet class instead to manage all the solar system bodies with objective to add planet satellites, asteroids, comete and manage planet obliquity, and rotation of the textures.
Remade in a coherent way all the s_utility conversion functions (in double precision).
Created a new class "stel_object" to manage the selected object in a good object oriented way.
Abandoned my previous vector class for a recreated version of the vecmath class (originally from celestia).
Use double precision for every planet, orbit and navigation calculation.
Centralized all the navigation/time variables and operations in a new class "navigator" instead of the non-object old navigation module.
The position of the observer on the earth is now taken into account in every calculation : the precision is dramaticaly improved, sun eclipses works etc...
Changed the command line handling : changes submitted by Cedric Delfosse.
Simplified 3D lighting operation for planets.
Fixed many many bugs related with coordinate.
Added an orbit calculation class stolen from the GPL soft celestia.
Added experimentaly jupiter satellites.
Improved object search and planets hints displaying.
Created a new class to render daylight atmosphere, with a faster and better algorithm.
Created a new class used to convert tone from high range luminance to CRT display luminance : the aim is to have an homogeneous luminance conversion to use with daylight sky as well as night sky and stars.
Changed the configuration file parser. The new one is much more convenient. It is based on a library called iniparser made by N.Devillard. I made a c++ wraper (init_parser class).
Re-made the old ui widget classes in a better way using functor callbacks and painters.
Re-thinked and made all the interface. stel_ui is now correct object oriented code.
Added a tab widget.
Created a new class to complete the daylight atmosphere model with the previously used model.
Now display computed atmosphere moon halo and realistic night sky brightness.
The stars appear in function of the sky luminance.
Made a correct object oriented solarsystem class. The planets are read from a file.
Added some planet satellites.
Improved optimization using gprof.
Finally fixed the planet shaking bug!
Updated fog and decor displaying (faster and nicer).
Added a projector class which will handle different projection mode (fisheye, ortho etc..)
Made a fisheye projection mode which override gl/glu functions so that 3D drawing occures in fisheye projection mode.
Added gravity font.
Added many options in the configuration files.
Made a class for landscapes managment. Handle fisheye projection and panoramic fisheye pictures projection. The landscapes are loaded from a file so that it's easy to add custom landscapes.
Stellarium is now fully object oriented.
Replaced most of the char* with c++ strings to prevent bugs.
Added a full text user interface.
Improved configuration managment.
Added a class "observator" for observer managment : i.e. observer's position and locales managment for timezone and time formating.
Improved the mouse selection of objects. The new algorithm is more intelligent.
Updated all the nebulas textures with clearly copyrighted pictures (See credits in README). This will fix the debian Bug#198495.
Re-made the graphical interface using tabs widgets etc..
Colors for lines and grid an other misc things are now a parameter in the config file.
Added a screen shot function (big thanks to cmdtab for his code).
Added handling of non-integer time zones (Thanks to Cool Andrew for his warning).
Added equatorial mode viewing.
Re-made all the GUI : new functions such as time setting, projection mode choice, saving in config file etc...

Added a GPL header on every sources files.
Globaly cleaned the code source.
Continued the gui.
Handle the Keyboard on the top of Glut.
Changed the drawing of the stars : 2D drawing is a lot faster and really only draw those which are in the field of view. The program is 20% faster!!
We now can't switch between resolution mode or fullscreen/windowed mode during the execution. This will prevent the program from crashs and hardware dependent bugs. Everything is statically configurable in config.txt.

Continued the gui : added classes like windows and label and a full implementation of callbacks.
Started to change the structure of the program.

0.4.0 [06/01/2002]
Started to write my own Graphic User Interface starting from the embryon of the one made by Chris Laurel in "Celestia" because MUI (given with the glut package isn't beautiful enought...). This gui will be independent of stellarium and very re-usable.
Did an attempt to use a tcl parser to manage a real config file but it was to heavy-> so i changed my mind and stop that...

0.3.9 [04/01/2002]
Create my own font manager : faster and more beautiful than before (I used bitmap font before).

0.3.3 [Before] :
I succed to compile my program in linux and windows with the same sources files !
I decided to share my source code in GPL.
My code was yet free but not very "readable" so i will try to comment it in english, and to make a version file (this file) etc... I now have to read docs to produce a "standard GNU code"...
