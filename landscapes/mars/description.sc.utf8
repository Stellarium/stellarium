<p> The panoramic camera on NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit took the
hundreds of images combined into this 360-degree view, the "Husband Hill
Summit" panorama. The images were acquired on Spirit's sols 583 to 586
(Aug. 24 to 27, 2005), shortly after the rover reached the crest of "Husband
Hill" inside Mars' Gusev Crater.
