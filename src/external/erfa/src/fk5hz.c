**
**  Transform an FK5 (J2000.0) star position into the system of the
**  Hipparcos catalog, assuming zero Hipparcos proper motion.
**
**  Given:
**     r5           double   FK5 RA (radians), equinox J2000.0, at date
**     d5           double   FK5 Dec (radians), equinox J2000.0, at date
**     date1,date2  double   TDB date (Notes 1,2)
**
**  Returned:
**     rh           double   Hipparcos RA (radians)
**     dh           double   Hipparcos Dec (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) This function converts a star position from the FK5 system to
**     the Hipparcos system, in such a way that the Hipparcos proper
**     motion is zero.  Because such a star has, in general, a non-zero
**     proper motion in the FK5 system, the function requires the date
**     at which the position in the FK5 system was determined.
**
**  2) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  3) The FK5 to Hipparcos transformation is modeled as a pure
**     rotation and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalog are not
**     taken into account.
**
**  4) The position returned by this function is in the Hipparcos
**     reference system but at date date1+date2.
