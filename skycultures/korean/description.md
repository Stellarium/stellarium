## Introduction

The Chinese, Korean, and Japanese constellations have the same origin and look very similar in shape. They are represented respectively in the Dun Huang starmap from the 8th century, the Cheon-Sang-Yeol-Cha-Bun-Ya-Ji-Do map and in the Kitora skymap painted in A.D.7C ~ 8C. Their positions and their names are similar in the Chinese alphabet. The name of the constellations first appear in the Records of the Grand Historian(史記) in Han dynasty describing Xia dynasty in about 2000 B.C.

## Description

### Origin

The 272 constellations displayed in this Stellarium sky culture are based on the Cheon-Sang-Yeol-Cha-Bun-Ya-Zi-Do, the Korean Constellation map, which was carved on the stone on 1395 but has its origin from another sky map which existed about 2,000 years ago. This map represents 1467 stars in about 190 constellations whose shapes are slightly different from the chinese ones. The interpretation of the map is not easy: the map is so old that only about 300 stars are found to match with the real stars. All the stars of the map were drawn on a circle, so the equator seems smaller than the southern limit. Because the density of constellation does not change with respect to the position, the position and the size of the constellations were somewhat altered in a way unknown by the author. It is assumed that there should be no bright stars which do not belong to any constellations. The work of the author is subject to interpretation, and could be changed at a later time. It will however roughly show what the Korean Constellation are like.
